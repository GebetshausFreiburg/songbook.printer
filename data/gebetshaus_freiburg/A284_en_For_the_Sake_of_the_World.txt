[C]  I'm laying down my [Csus]life, I'm giving up cont[C]rol,
I'm never looking [Csus]back, I surrender [Am]all.
I'm living for Your [F]glory on the [C]earth. [Csus]
[C]  This passion in my [Csus]heart, this stirring in my [C]soul
To see the nations [Csus]bow, for all the world to [Am]know
I'm living for Your g[F]lory on the [C]earth.  [Csus]

{soc}
  [C]  For the sake of the [F/C]world burn like a fire in [C]me. 
 Light a flame in my [F/C]soul for every eye to [Am]see. 
 For the sake of the [F]world burn like a fire in [C]me. [Csus]  [-to bridge] [G]

{comment: Bridge}

[Am]  For every knee to bow [F]down, for every heart to bel[C]ieve
For every voice to cry [G]out, burn like a fire in [Am]me.
For every tongue to conf[F]ess]King.
You are the hope of the [G]earth.
