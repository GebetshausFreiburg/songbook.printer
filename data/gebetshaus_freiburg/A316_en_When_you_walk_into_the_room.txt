1. When You [D]walk into the room, [G2]everything changes
[Bm7]Darkness starts to tremble at the [G2]light that You bring
When You [D]walk into the room, [G2]every heart starts burning
And [Bm7]nothing matters more 
Than just to [G2]sit here at Your feet and worship You


{soc}
  [D]  We love You, [G2]  and we'll never stop 
  [Bm7] We can't live with[G2]out you, Jesus 
  [D]  We love You, [G2]  and we can't get enough 
  [Bm7]  All this is [G2]for You, Jesus 
 {eoc}


2. When You [D]walk into the room, [G2]sickness starts to vanish
Every [Bm7]hopeless situation [G2]ceases to exist
And when You [D]walk into the room, the [G2]dead begin to rise
'Cause there is [Bm7]resurrection life in all You [G2]do


{comment: Bridge:}
[G2]Come and consume, God, all we are
We [Bm7]give You permission, our hearts are Yours
We w[D]ant You, we [A/C#]want You
