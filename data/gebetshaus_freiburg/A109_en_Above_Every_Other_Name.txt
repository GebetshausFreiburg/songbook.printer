[C]O Lord, my str[G]ength, You're my Re[Am]deemer
For[F]ever I will love You

[G/C]will ever be put to shame
[F/C]You are the Rock that is higher than I

{soc}
 Your [C]name is above every oth[G]er name 
 Your [Am]name is above every oth[F]er name 
 {eoc}


Halle[C]lujah, halle[G]lujah
Halle[Am]lujah, halle[F]lujah
