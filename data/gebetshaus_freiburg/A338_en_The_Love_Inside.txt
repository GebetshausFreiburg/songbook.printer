[Eb]  Do your eyes see me now? Are you smiling, are you proud?
[Bb]  I believe you are,[F]  and this changes everything

Your [Dm]heart´s so [Eb]full you [Bb]can´t con[F/A]tain it, [Dm]waves are [Eb]crashing [Gm]over [F]me
I [Dm]feel so [Eb]save I [Bb]can´t ex[F/A]plain it, [Dm]peace and [Eb]joy a[Gm]bound in [F]me


{soc}
 [Eb]  The love in[F]side of you is[Gm]  so pure,[Bb/D]  so right
 [Eb]  It fills all [F]heaven with its [Bb]light

[Eb]  Jesus, your [Bb/D]love is so amazing,[Eb]  and this [Fsus]joy I can´t explain it [Eb]
I´m [Gm]caught up in the fellow[Fsus]ship, I´m caught up in the fellowship

{comment: Bridge 2:}
[Eb] You´re the one, [Bb/D]there you go again, [Eb]lifting my heart, lifting [Fsus]my head
[Eb]Hope is [Gm]rising as I [Fsus]see you [Bb/D]smiling
