[D]Your name, oh [Bm]Lord, endures forev[G]er
Your fame, oh L[A]ord, for all t[D]ime
Your presence [Bm]Lord will leave me nev[G]er
Your love, oh L[A]ord, is all mine


[G]To Him by wisdom made the [A]heavens
And His [G]mercy ever[Bm]lasting
[Em]To the One who gives salvation
[A]I lift up my soul to You


{soc}
  [D]Jesus, [F#m]Savior, [Bm]ho-[A]ly [G]Lord 
  [G]I know that You'll never forsake [D]me or leave me al[A]one 
  [D]My Re[F#m]deemer, [Bm]Je-s[A]us [G]Christ 
 You [G]sacrificed Yourself on the c[D]ross to bring me [Em7]home 
 You brought me [C]home
