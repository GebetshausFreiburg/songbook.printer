1. [D]  My heart is [A]stirred by a [Bm]noble [G]theme
[D]  Bringing [A]blessed words [Bm]unto my [G]King
[D]  Giving [A]up my love as a [Bm]sweet offer[G]ing
[D]  Oh the [A]beauty of this [Bm]Man[G]

2. For the sake of love, He left His Father's throne
Searching for a bride, bone of His bone
Such a humble kiss to make my dust His own
Oh the beauty of this Man

3. See His hands, His head, His feet and His side
They bear the marks of wrath, a pure sacrifice
To secure my love by giving up His life
Oh the beauty of this Man

4. She now faint with love, beckons Him to come
Establish righteousness as God's risen son
On that glorious day, she'll marry her fair One
Oh the beauty of this Man

  [G]Jesus, I [D]love You,[A]       [Bm]  I give You all my [G]worship 
  Jesus, I [D]love You,[A]       [Bm]  Your name is Wonder[G]ful
