1.[D]What if I [F#m]spoke[Em]with the tongues of men and [Bm7]angels, but [A]had no [D]love:
I would be[F#m]come[Em]a noisy [Bm7]gong or a [A]clanging [D]cymbal
If I could [F#m]prophesy[Em]and know all myste[Bm7]ries [A]and all [D]knowledge
If I had [F#m]faith, [Em]the kind of faith to move [Bm7]mountains[A]
But [G]if I don't have the [D/F#]kind of love, the [Em]love it tak[Em/D]es [A]-  I am nothing
And [G]if I give all [D/F#]my possessions [Em]to the po[Em/D]or, [A]it profits me nothing

{soc}
 But [D]love is [Dmaj7]patient, [G]love is [Asus4]kind; [D]your love [Dmaj7]does it [G]every [Asus4]time 
  [D]Now a[Dmaj7]bides faith, [G]hope and [Asus4]love; [D]but the [Dmaj7]greatest of [G]these is [Asus4]love 
 {eoc}


2.[D]Love suffers [F#m]long[Em]and it is [Bm7]kind, it [A]is not [D]jealous,
It thinks no [F#m]evil,[Em]it does not re[Bm7]joice in in[A]iquit[D]y
Love never [F#m]fails,[Em]nor seeks its [Bm7]own but [A]always is [D]giving
I need [F#m]grace [Em]to walk in this [Bm7]love, Lord[A]
'Cause it [G]bears all things, be[D/F#]lieves all things
And [Em]hopes all thin[Em/D]gs, [A]endures all things
And [G]what I need is a [D/F#]whole lot more  of [Em]this pure lo[Em/D]ve [A]to show the world

{soc}
 That [D]love is [Dmaj7]patient, [G]love is [Asus4]kind; [D]your love [Dmaj7]does it [G]every [Asus4]time 
  [D]When my [Dmaj7]heart be[G]gins to [Asus4]cry, [D]your love [Dmaj7]does it[G]every, [Asus4]every time[D] [Dmaj7] [G] [Asus4]
