1. I will write a [A]wedding song,[E/G#]  it's a [F#m]noble theme I [Esus]sing.
My [D]heart it over[A/C#]flows with a [D]love song to the [Esus]King.
You’re the most [A]excellent of [E/G#]men, and your [F#m]words are filled with [Esus]grace.
God’s [D]favor rests u[A/C#]pon You – joy is [D]shining in your [Esus]face.


{soc}
  [A]Jesus [E/G#]-  you're the most [F#m]excellent[Esus] 
 You are so [D]beautiful, [A/C#]  there is [D]no one like [Esus]you
 {eoc}


2. From the [A]start you had a [E/G#]plan – a com[F#m]panion by your [Esus]side
Per[D]fected in your [A/C#]love – a [D]pure and spotless [Esus]bride.
And then I [A]hear you call my [E/G#]name – it’s the [F#m]sweetest voice I [Esus]know.
I will [D]leave it all be[A/C#]hind, Lord – where you [D]go I will [Esus]go.


The [D]music of the [E/B]strings makes you [F#m]glad [D]
And the [D]fragrance of my [E/B]praise is all [F#m]over you, all [D]over you
