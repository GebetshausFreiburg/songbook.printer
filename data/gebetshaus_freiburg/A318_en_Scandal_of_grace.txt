{title: Scandal of grace (A318)}
{artist: Joel Houston, Matt Crocker}

1. [A]Grace, what have You done, [F#m]murdered for [D]me on that [A]cross
Ac[A]cused in absence of wrong, my [F#m]sin washed a[D]way in Your [A]blood

{comment: Pre-Chorus 1:} 
Too [C#m]much to make [D]sense of it [A]all
I [C#m]know that Your [D]love breaks my [A]fall
The [E]scandal of grace - You [F#m]died in my place so my [D]soul will live


{soc}
 Oh to be [A]like You, give all I have just to [E6]know You 
 Jesus there's no-one be[D]side You, forever the hope in my [A]heart [D] [F#m] [D] 
 {eoc}


2. [A]Death where is your sting, your [F#m]power is as [D]dead as my [A]sin
The [A]cross has taught me to live and [F#m]mercy my [D]heart now to [A]sing

{comment: Pre-Chorus 2:}
The [C#m]day and its [D]troubles shall [A]come
I [C#m]know that Your [D]strength is e[A]nough
The [E]scandal of grace - You [F#m]died in my place so my [D]soul will live


{comment: Bridge:} 
And it's [A]all because of You, Jesus; it's [E]all because of You, Jesus
It's [F#m]all because of Your love that my [D]soul will live
