{title: Jesus, Lover of my Soul (A126)}
{artist: Paul Oakley}

It's all about [Am]you,[F] [C]Jes[G]us.
And all this is for [Am]you,[F]for your g[C]lory and your f[G]ame.
It's not about [Am]me,[F]as if [C]you should do things [F]my way.
[C]You alone are [G]God and I surr[F]ender to your [C]ways.

{soc}
  [C]Jes[F]us, [G]lover of my [C]soul! 
  [F]All consuming [C]fire is in your [Gsus]gaze[G]. 
  [C]Jes[F]us, [G]I want you to kn[C]ow. 
  [F]I will follow [C]you all of my [Gsus]days[G]. 
 {eoc}


For [C]no one else in [F]history is [Am]like [F]you.
And [C]history it[G]self belongs to [F]you.
[C]Alpha and Om[F]ega, you have [Am]loved [F]me.
And [C]I will spend et[F]ernity with [Gsus]you![G]
