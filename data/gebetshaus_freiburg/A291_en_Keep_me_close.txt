1. [A]What is there [E/G#]more than [G6]being wholly [D/F#]Yours
[Dm/F]What can com[A]pare to [Esus4]being in Your [A]hands

{comment: Pre-Chorus:}
[F#m] When the winds blow,[D]  when the storms rage
[A]  You still are Lord, [C#7/F]You never change
[F#m]  You're my refuge,[D]  my hiding place
[A]  When surrounded[C#7/F]   I call Your name[(D)]

{soc}
  [A]  Keep me close[Esus4]  to You, Lord 
  [F#m]  Where the winds may blow, [D]  only You will know 
  [A]  I will stay[Esus4]  in Your name, [F#m]  cause You keep me, Lord [D]  I know I am safe 
 {eoc}


2. [A]Who is a [E/G#]rock like [G6]You, Lord our [D/F#]God
[Dm/F]What is more [A]safe than [Esus4]trusting in Your [A]name

{comment: Bridge:}
[C#]And if You are [F#m]for me, [D]who could be a[A]gainst [E/G#]me
[C#]If You up[F#m]hold me, then [D]what could bring me [E]down

{comment: Ending:}
As [F#m]long as You keep me for[D]ever (I know I am safe)
As [A]long as You hold onto [E]my heart (I know I am safe)
