1. God from [D]God, light from light
We believe in [Bm]one Jesus Christ
Breaking through the [A]darkest nights to save
You alone can[G]save[Bm] [A]


2. Hope of [D]hope, strength of strength
All our sin is [Bm]dead in the grave
Only One has [A]power enough to save
You alone can[G]save[Bm], [A]You alone can[G]save[Bm] [A]

{soc}
  [G]Where there is no way You make a [D]way 
 Where [Bm]no one else can reach us,[A]You find us 
  [G]Where there is no way You make a [D]way 
 Where [Bm]no one else can reach us,[A]You find us
