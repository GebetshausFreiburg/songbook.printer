{title: Make a way (A391)}
{artist: Jason Ingram, Jon Egan}

1. God from [B]God, light from light
We believe in [G#m]one Jesus Christ
Breaking through the [F#]darkest nights to save
You alone can[E]save[G#m] [F#]


2. Hope of [B]hope, strength of strength
All our sin is [G#m]dead in the grave
Only One has [F#]power enough to save
You alone can[E]save[G#m], [F#]You alone can[E]save[G#m] [F#]

{soc}
  [E]Where there is no way You make a [B]way 
 Where [G#m]no one else can reach us,[F#]You find us 
  [E]Where there is no way You make a [B]way 
 Where [G#m]no one else can reach us,[F#]You find us 
 {eoc}

[B]Jesus, itâ€™s always been You; [G#m]Jesus, it always is You
[E]Jesus, it always will be [B]You[F#]
