1. Your [C#m]love has ravished my [B]heart
And taken me [E/G#]over, taken me [A]over
And [C#m]all I want is to [B]be
With you for[E/G#]ever, with you for[A]ever


{soc}
 [E]  Pull me a little [B/D#]closer, take me a little [C#m]deeper 
 I want to know your [A]heart, I want to know your [E]heart 
 'Cause your love is so much [B/D#]sweeter than anything I've [C#m]tasted 
 I want to know your [A]heart, I want to know your [E]heart 
 {eoc}

[A]  Who[E]a, who[B]a, how great is [C#m]your love
