1. [A]Great is the [D/A]Lord and most worthy of [A]praise
The [D/A]city of our God: the holy [F#m]place
The [A/E]joy of the whole [Bm7]earth[Esus] [E]


2. [A]Great is the [D/A]Lord in whom we have the victor[A]y
He [D/A]aids us against the ene[F#m]my
We [A/E]bow down on our [Bm7]knees[Esus] [E]

{soc}
 And [A]Lord we want to lift Your Name on [C#m]high 
 And [D2]Lord we want to thank You 
 For the [Bm7]works Youâ€™ve done in [D/E]our lives 
 And [A]Lord we trust in Your unfailing [C#m]love 
 For [D2]You alone are God eternal 
  [Bm7]Throughout earth and [D/E]heaven ab[A]ove 
 {eoc}
