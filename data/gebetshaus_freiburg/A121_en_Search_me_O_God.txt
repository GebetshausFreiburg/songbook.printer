{artist: Vicky Beaching}

[D]Search me O God, search me and [A/C#]find
[Bm7]any way in me that does [G]not reflect Your [Asus4]purity
Re[D]fine me O God in the fire of Your [A/C#]gaze
That [Bm7]I might be holy in [G]all of my [Asus4]ways


Pre-Chorus:
[C]Take me [G/B]deeper, [D]Lord.
[C]Draw me [G/B]closer, [D]Lord[Asus4]


{soc}
 Give me a [D/F#]heart[G] [Asus4]after Your [D/F#]own[G] [Asus4]heart 
 Give me a [Bm7]mind that is [G]pure and pleasing to [Asus4]You [A] 
 Fill me with [D/F#]love,[G] [Asus4]with Your [D/F#]power [G]and Your [Asus4]joy 
 That this world might[C]see [G/B]You in [D]me 
 {eoc}
