1. You un[C]ravel me with a melody
You sur[F]round me w[G]ith a s[C]ong
Of de[C]liverance from my enemies
Till [F]all my [G]fears are g[C]one


{soc}
 I'm no l[F]onger a s[G]lave to f[C]ear 
 [Am]I am a c[G]hild of [C]God 
 I'm no l[F]onger a s[G]lave to f[C]ear 
 [Am]I am a c[G]hild of [C]God 
 {eoc}


2. From my [C]mother's womb You have [Em]chosen me
[F]Love has c[G]alled my [C]name
I've been [C]born again into Your [Em]family
Your [F]blood flows [G]through my [C]veins


Bridge: 
[Am]  You split the [G]sea so I could [C]walk right [F]through it
[Am]  My fears were [G]drowned in perfect [C]love [F]
[Am]  You rescued [G]me so I could [C]stand and [Em]sing
I [F]am a [G]child of [C]God
