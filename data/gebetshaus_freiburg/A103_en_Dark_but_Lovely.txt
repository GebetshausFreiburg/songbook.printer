I can't [C]understand this [F2]work of grace
How a per[C]fect God would come and [F2]take my place

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
The [F2]stars, they don't move You
The [C/E]waves can't undo You
The [D4]mountains in their splendor
They [Dm]cannot steal Your heart
This [F2]God who is holy, [C/E]perfect in beauty
[D4]Awesome in glory is [Dm]ravished by my heart

{soc}
 Though I'm [F]poor, You [Am]say I am [G]lovel[C]y 
 Though I'm [F]dark, You [Am]say I am [G]beauti[C]ful 
 {eoc}


{comment: Bridge}
[F]Somehow my [Am]weak glance[G]has overwh[C]elmed You[C/E]
[F]And somehow my [Am]weak love has [G]stolen away Your [C]heart
