key: G

1.[G]  In the secret place where I see Your face
[Am7]  Will You [C]take me there ag[G]ain?
[G]  You can search my heart in the deepest part
[Am7]  From be[C]ginning to the [G]end


{comment: Pre-Chorus:}
[D]  To You my [C]eyes are lifting, [D]  to You my [C]prayer is ris[Em]ing up
[D]  You’ve captured [C]my attention, [D]  consume me, [C]consume me


{soc}
  [G]God, give me a [Am7]heart a[C]bandoned 
  [G]Ever after [Am7]You a[C]lone 
  [G]Gold and silver, [Am7]You can [C]take it 
  [G]All I want is [Am7]You, my [C]Lord 
 {eoc}


2.[G]  You can have my soul, just like Jericho
[Am7]  Come and [C]tear down my [G]walls
[G]  And I am in Your hands, You are the Promised Land
[Am7]  You are the [C]King of my [G]heart


3.[G]  When I’ve been the fool and I hid from You
[Am7]  You still [C]called out my na[G]me
[G]  When my flesh is weak, will You help me see
[Am7]  You are [C]all that I ne[G]ed, [Am7]You are [C]all that I ne[G]ed
