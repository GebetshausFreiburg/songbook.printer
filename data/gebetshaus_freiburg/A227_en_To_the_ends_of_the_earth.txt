{artist: Joel Houston, Marty Sampson}

[Em]Love un[C2]failing, [G]overt[D]aking my h[Em]eart[C2]
You [G]take me in[D]
[Em]Finding pe[C2]ace again, [G]fear is lo[D]st in all Yo[C2]u are


{comment: Pre-Chorus}
And [D]I would give the world to tell Your st[Em]ory
'Cause I know that You've c[C2]alled me, I know that You've c[G]alled me
I've [D]lost myself for good within Your pr[C2]omise
And I won't h[Em]ide it, I won't h[C2]ide it

{soc}
  [G]Jesus, I believe in You, and [D]I would go 
 To the [Am7]ends of the earth, to the [C2]ends of the earth 
 For You[G]alone are the Son of God, and [F2]all the world will see 
 That You a[Am7]re God, You a[C2]re God 
 {eoc}
