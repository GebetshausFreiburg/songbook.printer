1.[A]Come als close as You [F#m2]want
Consume this [C#m]heart that longs to bu[A]rn
I know Your fire can [F#m2]hurt
But I would be wor[C#m]se here without Y[A]ou

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
For [D]I was [Bm7]made to dwell with y[E]ou [Esus] [E]
and h[D]ow I a[Bm7]che until I d[E]o [Esus] [E]

{soc}
 Holy G[A]od take my he[D]art 
 Purge with fl[F#m]ame and tr[E]uth 
 A holy hea[A]rt is all I wa[D]nt 
 That I may [F#m]live with Y[E]ou 
 To live with y[A]ou 
 {eoc}


2.[A] Come and take all these [F#m]chains
That get in the [C#m]way of what You [A]want
[A] As I stand in the [F#m]flame
Still I will [C#m]say I trust You [A]God

To live with Y[E]ou, to [F#m]live with Y[E]ou
