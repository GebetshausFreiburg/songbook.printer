  [Am]Holy, [G]Holy 
  [Am]Eternity’s eternal [G]song is drawing me and calling me a[Am]way (x2) 
 It’s calling me aw[G]ay 
 {eoc}


1.[Am]All flesh is [F]grass, fading a[C]way, only You [G]last, only You re[Am]main (x2)
The same, You [F]never change
[C]Holy, holy holy, You are [G]fairer than the sons of [Am]man


2. Surely [Am]man is like a flower of the [F]field,
and surely [C]life is but a vapor, at [G]best it’s but a vapor
[Am]Man is like a flower of the [F]field
a [C]fragrance, but a vapor, at [G]best it’s but a vapor
but You, oh God, are better than a thousand blooms


Bridge:
[Am]Hallelu[F]jah, Amen! [C]Hallelu[G]jah, Amen!
