[Am]Holy, [G]Holy

{soc}
 [Am]  Eternity’s eternal [G]song is drawing me and calling me a[Am]way (x2)
 It’s calling me aw[G]ay
 {eoc}

1.[Am]  All flesh is [F]grass, fading a[C]way, only You [G]last, only You re[Am]main (x2)
The same, You [F]never change
[C]Holy, holy holy, You are [G]fairer than the sons of [Am]man


2. Surely [Am]man is like a flower of the [F]field,
and surely [C]life is but a vapor, at [G]best it’s but a vapor
[Am]Man is like a flower of the [F]field
a [C]fragrance, but a vapor, at [G]best it’s but a vapor
but You, oh God, are better than a thousand blooms
