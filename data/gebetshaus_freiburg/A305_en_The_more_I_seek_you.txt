[E]  The more I [B/D#]seek you
[C#m]  The more I [A]find You
[E]  The more I [B/D#]find You
[C#m]  The more I [A]love You 
 
 
{soc}
 [E]  I wanna sit at your [B/D#]feet, drink from the cup in Your [C#m]hand
 Lay back against you and [A]breathe, feel Your [Bsus]heart[B]beat 
 [E]  This love is so [B/D#]deep, it's more than I can [C#m]stand 
 I melt in Your [A]peace, it's over[Bsus]whel - [B]ming
