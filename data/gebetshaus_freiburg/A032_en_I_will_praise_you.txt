1. It was from the [F#m]depths that you grabbed me
you've [C#m]called me and pulled me [D]up from the miry [A]clay


PreChorus:
It took the [D]blood of [E]one, the [F#m]pure and [E]spotless [D]lamb
It took the [D]blood of [E]one, the man from [D]heaven [E]


{soc}
 And I will [Asus]praise [A]you. I will [G/B]love you with all my heart
 And I will [D]thank [A]you for[Esus]ever and [E]ever
 {eoc}


2. It was when [F#m]I was undeserving 
and [C#m]rightfully earning e[D]ternal separation from [A]you


Bridge:
As I [A/C#]see the height from [D]which you reign 
and the [A/C#]depths to which you [Bm]came
And as I [A/C#]see the height to [F#m]which you brought me 
and the [Esus]depth from which you [E]saved
