Be lifted [E]up.
Be lifted [B]up.
As we [A]bow down,[B]be lifted [E]up.

{soc}
  [A]Let the heavens re[E]joice let the nations be g[A]lad. 
 Let the whole earth tr[E]emble for you are G[A]od. 
 Come and worship the [C#m]Lord in the beauty of H[B]oliness. 
 {eoc}


As we [A]bow down[B]be lifted [E]up.
As we [A]bow down[B]be lifted [E]up.
