{title: One thing remains (A363)}
{artist: Brian Johnson, Christa Black Gifford, Jeremy Riddle}

1. [C]Higher than the [G]mountains that I [D]face
[C]Stronger than the [G]power of the [D]grave
[C]Constant in the [G]trial and the [D]change
One [C]thing[G]rem[D]ains (repeat)

{soc}
 Your [Em]love never fails, it [C]never gives up 
  [G]Never runs out on [D]me (3x) 
 {eoc}


2. [C]On and on and [G]on and on it [D]goes
It [C]overwhelms and [G]satisfies my [D]soul
And I [C]never, ever, [G]have to be [D]afraid
One [C]thing[G]rem[D]ains


Bridge:
In [C]death, in [G]life, I’m [D]confident and [Am7]covered
by the [C]power of [G]Your great [D]love
My [C]debt is [G]paid, there’s [D]nothing that can [Am7]separate
my [C]heart from [G]Your great [D]love
