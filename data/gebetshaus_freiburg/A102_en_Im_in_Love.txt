{artist: Tim Reimherr}

[Emaj7]You are good, I a[Amaj7]dore
[E/G#]As I should, I want [F#m7]more
[Emaj7]You are kind, I [Amaj7]bow
[E/G#]All my life, I pour [F#m7]out


I've [C#m]never known another
As [G#m7]kind in this l[A]ife, as [B]You
[C#m]All the others cross the [G#m7]road
And pass me [A]by, but nor [B]You

{soc}
 I'm in [E]love, 
 From the moment that I saw Your face
 I'm in [Amaj7]love, 
 You never turn away Your gaze
 I'm in [C#m7]love, 
 Now the reason for the rest of my days
 Is to [B]love You, I will love You 
 {eoc}
