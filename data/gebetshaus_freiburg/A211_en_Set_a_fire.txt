[D]No place I would rather be
[G]No place I would rather be
[Bm]No place I would rather be
Than [G]here in your love, here in your love


{soc}
  [D]Set a fire down in my s[G]oul 
 That I can't contain and I can't cont[Bm]rol 
 I want more of you God[G], I want more of you God 
 {eoc}



Fill me up God (x3)
Fill me up
