1. [G]Wonderful, so [A]wonderful is [D/F#]Your unfailing love
Your [G]cross has spoken [A]mercy over [Bm7]me
No [G]eye has seen, no [A]ear has heard , no [D/F#]heart could fully know,
How [G]glorious, how [A]beautiful You [D]are


{soc}
 Beautiful [G]One, I [A]love You 
 Beautiful [G]One, I [A]adore 
 Beautiful [G]One my [A]soul must [D]sing 
 {eoc}


2. [G]Powerful, so [A]powerful, Your [D/F#]glory fills the skies
Your [G]mighty works disp[A]layed for all to [Bm7]see
The [G]beauty of Your [A]majesty a[D/F#]wakes my heart to sing;
How [G]marvelous, how [A]wonderful You [D]are


Bridge:
You [G]opened my eyes to Your [A]wonders anew
You [G]captured my heart with this [A]love
'Cause [G]nothing on earth is as [A]beautiful as [D]You
