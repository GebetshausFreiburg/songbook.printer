[D]  Though I sleep, my heart is aw[G]ake
[D]  Though it's night, on You I w[G]ait
It's been a long n[A]ight, and I am w[G]eary
It's been a long t[A]ime, and I am h[G]ungry


So I'll [Bm]wait in the st[A]illness ag[G]ain, I'll [Bm]wait in the qu[A]iet ag[G]ain


For when I heard Your [D/F#]voice, when You said my n[G]ame
When I heard Your [Bm]voice my heart it y[A]earned (Repeat)
In the middle of the [D/F#]night, in the middle of the n[G]ight
In the middle of the [Bm]night my heart it y[A]earns  (Repeat)


{soc}
 Though You're far aw[D/F#]ay, still I'm here to [G]say: 
 'I am [Bm]Yours, I am [A]Yours'. 
 And when You feel so far aw[D/F#]ay, still I am here to [G]say: 
 'I am [Bm]Yours, I am [A]Yours' 
 (2nd time) 'I am [D/F#]Yours, I am Y[G]ours', 'I am [Bm]Yours, I am Y[A]ours' 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
And I pay my [D/F#]vows, no [G]turning ar[A]ound
I burn the b[D/F#]ridges, they c[G]an't be f[A]ound (Repeat)
