1. This is my[F#m7]cry, [A2]this is my s[E]ong
You are my [F#m7]guiding light [A2]when the way is unkn[E]own
And when these [F#m7]sunny skies [A2]turn shades of gr[E]ay
I'll stay close [F#m7]by Your side [A2]as You lead the w[E]ay

{soc}
 Jesus lead [D]on,[A]I will f[E]ollow 
 Jesus lead [D]on, let Your [A]love light the w[E]ay 
 Jesus lead [D]on,[A]I will f[E]ollow, Jesus lead [D]on[A] [G] [E] 
 {eoc}


2. Hear now this[F#m7]cry, [A2]hear now this s[E]ong
You are the [F#m7]guiding light [A2]for this journey I'm [E]on
And when my [F#m7]vision is clouded [A2]by the wind and the r[E]ain
I'll stay close [F#m7]by Your side [A2]as You lead the w[E]ay


Bridge:
[Bm7]Lead me [E]on, [Bm7]lead me [E]on
[Bm7]Lead me [E]on, I will [D]follow[A] [G] [E]
