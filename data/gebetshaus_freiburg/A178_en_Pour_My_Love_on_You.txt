{title: Pour My Love on You (A178)}
{artist: Dan Dean, Gary Sadler}

1.[C]I [G/B]don't know [F]how to say exactly how I f[C]eel
And I [G/B]can't beg[F]in to tell you what your [G]love has m[Am]eant, I'm [G]lost for [Fmaj9]words


2.[C]Is [G/B]there a [F]way to show the passion in my h[C]eart
Can [G/B]I expr[F]ess how truly great I th[G]ink you [Am]are, my d[G]earest [Fmaj9]friend


Pre-Chorus:
[Dm]Lord, [C/E]this is my de[Gsus]sire [G]
[Dm]To [C/E]pour my love on [Gsus]you


{soc}
 Like [G]oil upon your [C]feet, like wine for you to [F2]drink 
 Like water from my [Am]heart I pour my love on [Gsus]you 
 If [G]praise is [G7]like per[C/E]fume I'll lavish mine on [F2]you 
 'Til ev'ry drop is [Am]gone I'll pour my [Gsus]love [G]on [F2/A]you [(G/B)] 
 {eoc}
