{artist: Ben Fielding, Reuben Morgan}

1. God is [G]able , He will [Dsus]never fail
[Em]He is almighty [C]God
Greater than [G]all we seek, greater than [Dsus]all we ask
[Em]He has [C]done great [Dsus]things

{soc}
 Lifted [G]up, He de[Dsus]feated the grave 
 Raised to [Em]life, Our God is [C]able 
 In His [G/B]name we overc[D]ome 
 For the [Em]Lord our [Dsus]God is [C]able 
 {eoc}


2. God is [G]with us, God is [Dsus]on our side
[Em]He will make a [C]way
Far above [G]all we know, far above [Dsus]all we hope
[Em]He has [C]done great [Dsus]things



Bridge: God is [G/B]with us, He will [Dsus]go before
He will never [Em]leave us,[Dsus]He will never [C]leave us
God is [G/B]for us, He has [Dsus]open arms
He will never [Em]fail us,[Dsus]He will never [C]fail us
