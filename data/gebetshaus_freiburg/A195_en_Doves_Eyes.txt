[D]I don't want to [D/C#]talk ab[Bm]out You like You're [Bm/A]not in the [G]room
I want to look right [Asus4]at You, I want to sing right [D]to You (x2)


I be[D/C#]lieve You are [Bm]listen[Bm/A]ing
[G]I believe that You [Asus4]move at the sound of my voice (x2)


{soc}
 Give me [D]dove's [D/C#]eyes[Bm] [Bm/A] 
 Give me [G]undistracted devotion for [Asus4]only You.
