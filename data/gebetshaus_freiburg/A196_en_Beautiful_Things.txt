1. [G]All [A/G]this [D]pain, I wonder if Iâ€™ll [G]ever [A/G]find my [D]way
I wonder if my [G]life could [A/G]really [Bm]change [Asus]at [G]all
[G]All [A/G]this [D]earth, could all that is [G]lost e[A/G]ver be [D]found
Could a garden [G]come up [A/G]from this [Bm]ground [Asus]at [G]all [A/G] [D]

{soc}
  [D]You make beautiful things, You make beautiful things out of the dust 
  [D]You make beautiful things, You make beautiful things out of us 
 {eoc}


2. [G]All [A/G]ar[D]ound, hope is springing [G]up from [A/G]this old [D]ground
Out of chaos [G]life is [A]being [Bm]found [Asus]in [G]You [A/G] [D]

{soc}
  [Gmaj7]You make beautiful things, You make beautiful things out of the dust 
  [D]You make beautiful things, You make beautiful things out of us 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
[D]You make me [F#m]new, You are [G]making me [D]new

{soc}
  [D]You make beautiful [F#m]things, You make beauti[G]ful things out of the [D]dust 
  [D]You make beautiful [F#m]things, You make beauti[G]ful things out of [D]us 
 {eoc}
