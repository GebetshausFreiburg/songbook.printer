{title: Heart after You (A106)}
{artist: Luke Wood}

I want to stand in Your c[D]ounsel to sit at [A]Your [G]table
And speak to You f[D]ace to face as [A]a [G]friend
I want to stand in Your f[D]ire wherever [A]Your [G]eyes fall
May You find me [D]faithful to [A]Your [G]heart

{soc}
 Let me be [D]found [A] [G] 
 With a heart after [D]You [A] [G] 
 May Your eyes [D]find [A]this [G]heart loyal to [D]You [A] [G] 
 {eoc}


May You be [G]all that's [Bm]on my [A]mind all of the [G]time [Bm] [A]
Let my [G]heart be [Bm]torn in [A]two until your will is [D]mine [Bm] [A]
[G]Dearly [Bm]Be[A]loved of my [G]soul [D] [A]
