I wanna be un[C#m]movable, unshakable
Let my [A]roots go down deep
Unm[E]ovable, unshakable in You[B]


{soc}
  [C#m]I, I want to be like a tr[A]ee 
 Planted by the stre[E]ams 
 Of living w[B]ater 
 {eoc}



This will be my [C#m]song, God.
This will be my pr[A]ayer
'til the [E]end, until the [B]end
