{artist: Matt Redman}

J[D]esus C[A/D]hrist, I [G/D]think upon your s[D]acrifice.
Y[G]ou became [D/F#]nothing p[G]oured out to [Asus]death.[A]
M[D]any [A/D]times I've [G/D]wondered at your g[D]ift of life
And [G]I'm in that [Asus]place once [A]ag[D]ain.
[G]I'm in that [Asus]place once [A]ag[D]ain.

{soc}
 And [D/F#]once again I l[G]ook upon the [D/F#]cross where you [Asus]died.[A] 
 I'm [D/F#]humbled by your m[G]ercy and I'm b[D/F#]roken in[Asus]side.[A] 
  [Bm7]Once again I th[G]ank you. [D/F#]Once again I p[A]our out my l[G]ife.[Asus] [A] [D] 
 {eoc}

N[D]ow you [A/D]are ex[G/D]alted to the h[D]ighest place.
K[G]ing of all [D/F#]heavens where [G]one day I'll [Asus]bow.[A]
B[D]ut for n[A/D]ow I m[G/D]arvel at this [D/F#]saving grace.
And [G]I'm full of pr[Asus]aise once [A]ag[D]ain.
[G]I'm full of pr[Asus]aise once [A]ag[D]ain.
