{title: Days of Elijah (A198)}
{artist: Robin Mark}

1. [G]These are the days of E[C]lijah, de[G]claring the [D]Word of the [G]Lord
And [G]these are the days of Your [C]servant Moses, [G]righteousness [D]being rest[G]ored
And [Bm]though these are days of great [Em]trial, of [Am]famine and [C]darkness and [D]sword
Still, [G]we crying, 'Pre[G]pare ye the [D]way of the [G]Lord!'

{soc}
 Behold, He [G]comes riding on the [C]clouds 
 Shining like the [G]sun at the trumpet [D]call 
 Lift your [G]voice, it's the year of jubi[C]lee 
 And out of Zion's [G]hill sal[D]vation [G]comes 
 {eoc}


2. [G]These are the days of Ez[C]ekiel, the [G]dry bones bec[D]oming as [G]flesh
And [G]these are the days of Your [C]servant David, reb[G]uilding a [D]temple of [G]praise
And [Bm]these are the days of the [Em]harvest, the [Am]fields are as [C]white in Your [D]world
And [G]we are the labourers [C]in Your vineyard, dec[G]laring the [D]Word of the [G]Lord


Bridge:
[G]There is no god like Jehovah,[C]there is no god like Jehovah
[G]There is no god like Jehovah,[D]there is no god like Jehovah
