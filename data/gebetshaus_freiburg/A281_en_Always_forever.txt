1. [A]You are the hand that [F#m]catches my fall.
[Esus]You are the friend that [D]answers my call.
[A]You are my day, [F#m]You are my night.
[Esus]You are my love, and [D]all of my life.[E]

{soc}
 You are the [A]love I [E]need, You are the [F#m]air I [D]breathe. 
 You are my [A]love, my [E]life, always for[D]ever. 
 I would lay [A]down my [E]life, just to be [F#m]by your [D]side. 
 You are my [A]love, my [E]life, always for[D]ever, always for[A]ever. 
 {eoc}


2. [A]You are the grace that [F#m]covers my sin.
[Esus]You're everything, the be[D]ginning and end.
[A]You have my soul, my [F#m]heart and my mind.
[Esus]You have my love and [D]all of my life.[E]
