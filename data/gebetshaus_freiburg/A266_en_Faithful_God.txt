1. [Am]In the darkest [F]night, when the sun doesn't [C]shine
In the darkest night of my [G]soul
[Am]I hear you call my [F]name
I see you walk in the [C]rain
And I know you're in con[G]trol

Bridge: [C]You know the depth of my deepest [F]sin
Yet you call me as your [Am]friend


You gave your [C]very [F]best to [G]me
[C]Every morning I seek your face
[Am]Every evening I feel your grace
You are my [F]first love, you are my [G]faithful God
[C]Every day is a brand new day


[Am]I see your face as you look my way
You are my first love, you are my [G]faithful God
