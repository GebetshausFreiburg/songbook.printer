 I am lo[D]vesick, for my Be[G]loved 
 My Be[D]loved and my Frie[G/B]nd (x2) 
 Only You can satisfy [D] [G] [D] [G](x2) 
 {eoc}


[D]Try as I may to chase another Lover
I [G]find there is, there is no other (x2)
For [D]only You can satisfy (x2)


And ha[Bm]ppy am [G]I, to live a [D]hungry life
[Bm]Blessed am [G]I, to [D]thirst
Disil[Bm]lusionm[G]ent, it is my [D]gift within
I am [Bm]blessed, I am [G]blessed among [D]men!


And [Bm]happy am [G]I, to live a [D]hungry life
[Bm]Blessed am [G]I, to [D]thirst
My de[Bm]sire for [G]you, it is my [D]gift within
I am [Bm]blessed, I am [G]blessed among [D]men!


[D]All the other Lovers fade away (x3)


Tag: And the [Bm]Spirit and the [G]bride say, [D]Come!
We say [Bm]Co  [G]- [D]me.
