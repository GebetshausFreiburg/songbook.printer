{title: Song of Salomon (A192)}
{artist: Martin Smith}

1. [C]When I feel the cold of [Em7/B]winter and this cloak of [F]sadness, I need Y[C]ou
[C]All the evil things that [Em7/B]shake me, all the words that br[F]eak me, I need Y[C]ou

{soc}
  [Am]Over the [G6]mountains, [Dm]over the [Am]sea 
  [Am]Here You come [G6]running, my [F]Lover to [C]me 
 {eoc}


2. [C]Do not hide me from Your [Em7/B]presence, pull me from these sh[F]adows, I need Y[C]ou
[C]Beauty wrap Your arms a[Em7/B]round me, sing Your song of [F]kindness I need Y[C]ou


{soc}
  [Am]Over the [G6]mountains, [Dm]over the [Am]sea 
  [Am]Here You come [G6]running, my [F]Lover to [C]me 
  [Am]All through the [G6]valleys th[Dm]rough the dark of [Am]night 
  [Am]Here You come [G6]running to [F]hold me till it’s [C]light. 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
I'll come [C]running, come [Bb]running, come [Dm7]running back to [C]You
