O t[C]aste and [Am]see that the [G]Lord is [F]good
O t[C]aste and [Am]see that the [G]Lord is [F]good to me

You've t[C]urned my mourning [Am]into dancing
Put off[G]my rags and cl[F]othed me with gladness
And [F]I will arise and [Am]I will praise you
I'll s[G]ing and not be s[F]ilent

 O L[C]ord, my [Am]God, I w[G]ill give thanks to y[F]ou forever 
 O Lord[C], my God[Am],   I w[G]ill give thanks to y[F]ou

I will li[G]ft these hands up to y[F]ou
I will da[G]nce befo[F]re you
I will shout [G]it, I will sho[F]ut it to you
