  [Bm]Where you go I go 
 What you say I [F#m/A]say 
 What you pray I [Em]pray 
 What you pray I [Em]pray 
 {eoc}



[Bm]Jesus only did [F#m/A]what he saw you do
[Em]He would only say what he heard you speak
[Bm]He would only move [F#m/A]when he felt you lead
[Em]Following your heart, following your Spirit


{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[Bm]How could I expect to walk with[A2]out you
When [Em]every move that Jesus made was in surrender
[Bm]I will not begin to live with[A2]out you
For [Em]you alone are worthy and [F#sus]you are always [F#]good


{comment: Bridge}
Though the [Bm]world sees and soon forgets
[A2]We will not forget who you are and what you've [Em]done for us
