1. [Dm]Grace, you've shown me [Bb]grace
You've lifted my [F]shame, drawn me with [C]loving kindness
[Dm]Washed whiter than [Bb]snow - You have re[F]deemed and made me [C]whole 


{soc}
 [Bb]Jes[F]us you have [C]won me, You have [Dm]broken every [Bb]chain 
 With [F]love and [C]mercy
 You have [Dm]triumphed over [Bb]death and [F]You are [C]worthy 
 Of glory and [Bb]praise[F]  [C]
 {eoc}


2. [Dm]Love, you've shown me [Bb]love by leaving your [F]throne
By bleeding and [C]dying on a [Dm]cross; that wonderful [Bb]cross
That took all my [F]guilt and sin [C]away


{comment: Bridge}
[Bb]Shout it out and [F]lift up one [C]voice in [Gm11]worship
[Bb]Sing it out un[F]til all the [C]earth can [Dm7]hear it
[Bb]Jesus is a[F]live and he [C]saves, he rescues and [Bb]saves [F]  [C]
