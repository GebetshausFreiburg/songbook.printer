{title: Worth it all (A200)}
{artist: Rita Springer}

1. I don't unders[G/B]tand Your ways, but I will [C2]give You my song
[Am7]I'll give You all of my [G]prai[Gsus]se [G]
You hold on to [G/B]all my pain, and with it You are [C2]pulling me closer
[Am7]Pulling me into Your [G]wa[Gsus]ys [G]


Pre-Chorus:
Now around every [Em7]corner, and up every [Dsus]mountain
I'm not [G]looking for [D/F#]crowns or the [Am7]water from fountains
I'm [Em7]desperate in seeking, [Dsus]frantic, believing
That the [G]sight of Your [D/F#]face is [Am7]all that I'm needing
I will say to you

{soc}
  [G]It's gonna be worth it 
  [D/F#]It's gonna be worth it 
  [Em7]It's gonna be worth it [C2]all 
 {eoc}
