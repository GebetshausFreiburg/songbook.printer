1. There's a place I've [D]been [Dsus]
More [D]real that what I [Dsus]see
You led me by the h[D]and [Dsus]
In[D]to the chamber of the [Dsus]King


Prechorus
Take me [G]away to the [D/F#]place
That I ne[Em]ver want to leave


2. I've tasted and I've [D]known [Dsus]
Of a [D]love that's better than [Dsus]wine
Come to me my [D]Lord, [Dsus]
only [D]you can satis[Dsus]fy

{soc}
 I can't [D]wait[A/C#]for our [Bm]wedding day to c[G]ome 
 Let me see your [D]face,[A/C#]let me [Bm]feel your arms of l[G]ove 
 {eoc}



3 . I have been be[D]trothed [Dsus]
To the [D]King above all [Dsus]Kings
I am not my [D]own [Dsus]
And you [D]pledged yourself to [Dsus]meï»¿
