1. We are [E]marching to the [C#m]beat of different drum
To the [A]beat of a perfect heart, here [E]today
We are [E]marching on a [C#m]road to a distant land
and I can [A]see the Savior’s hand reaching to [E]me


2. We are [E]sailing on a [C#m]ship on a crystal sea
And I can [A]see our destination in the [E]air
It is [E]rising like a [C#m]castle in the sky
And it’s [A]filled with heaven’s light every[E]where


{soc}
 And I can hear Him [B]say,[A] 'Come and follow [E]me' 
 'I will take you [B]there,[A] come and follow [E]me' 
 'Leave it all be[B]hind,[A] come and follow [C#m]me' 
 [B]  I can hear Him [A]calling out my name]me' 
 {eoc}


3. I can [E]hear it like the [C#m]sound of a mighty rain
Like the [A]sound of a diesel train headed for [E]me
I can [E]feel it like the [C#m]trembling of the ground
And I [A]know that I am bound for eterni[E]ty


4. He is [E]coming like the [C#m]flash of a neon light
He will [A]tear apart the sky when He ap[E]pears
When we [E]see Him we will [C#m]finally be like Him
We will [A]finally see Him clearly just as He [E]is
