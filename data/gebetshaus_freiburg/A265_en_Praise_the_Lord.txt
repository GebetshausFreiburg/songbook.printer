  [E]  Praise the Lord, O my [G#m]soul
  And let [C#m]all that is wit[B]hin me praise His [E]name
  [E]  Praise the Lord, O my [G#m]soul
  And let [C#m]all that is wit[B]hin me praise His [E]name
 {eoc}


[C#m]  For I will not die; I will [B]live 
I will tell of the works of the [A]Lord and sing of His [B]wonders 
[C#m]I will not die, I will [B]live; [A]I will not die, I will [B]live 


He is a great [E]God,[G#m]   He is a great  [C#m]God   [B]


[E]I get to [G#m]love you through what[C#m]ever comes; what a [B]privilege
That [E]I get to [G#m]love You through what[C#m]ever comes; O how [B]sweet it is


[E]Nothing's gonna take Your praise out of my[G#m]  mouth
As long as I shall[C#m]  live, as long as I shall[B]  live
