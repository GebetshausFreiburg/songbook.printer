{artist: Matt Crocker}
key: Bm

1. [Bm]Here I am, down on my [D]knees again
Surrendering [A]all, surrendering [G]all 
[Bm]Find me here, Lord, as You [D]draw me near
Desperate for [A]You, desperate for [G]You 
I Surren[Bm]der   [D]   [A]   [G]

2. [Bm]Drench my soul as mercy and [D]grace unfold 
I hunger and [A]thirst, I hunger and [G]thirst
With [Bm]arms stretched wide I know You [D]hear my cry
Speak to me [A]now, speak to me [G]now.


{soc}
 I sur[Bm]render, I sur[D]render
 I want to [Em]know You more, I want to [G]know You more
 {eoc}


{comment: Bridge:} 
Like a [G]rushing [D]wind, Jesus, [A]breathe within
Lord have your [Em]way, Lord have your [Bm]way in [A]me
Like a [G]mighty [D]storm stir with[A]in my soul
Lord have your [Em]way, Lord have your [Bm]way in [A]me.
