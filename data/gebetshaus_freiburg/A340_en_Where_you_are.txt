1. [C]I can't get enough, no, [Am]I can't get enough
Of [Dm]Your amazing love [F]I can't get enough

2. [C]I can't walk away, no, [Am]I can't walk away
For [Dm]I have seen Your face and [F]I can't walk away


{soc}
 And [C]I just wanna be where You are 
 [Am]I just wanna be near Your heart 
 There is [Dm]nothing like Your love 
 There is [F]nothing like Your love
