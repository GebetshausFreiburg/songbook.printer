{title: Hope of the world (A225)}
{artist: Reuben Morgan, Jason Ingram, Matthew Bronleewee}

1. For the [D]love poured out. For the [F#m]price of freedom [E]
Let the [D]whole earth sing. Hear the [F#m]praises rising [E]
We [D]stand in awe of [F#m]what you've done for [A/C#]us at the [E]cross

{soc}
 The hope of the [D]world, lifted on [A]high 
 Calling us [F#m]home with arms out [E]wide 
 To know you for[D]ever, to love you for[F#m]ever 
 You are our [E]everything 
 {eoc}


2. Our [D]sin erased, [F#m]we are forgiven [E]
You [D]made a way. [F#m]You are our ransom [E]
We [D]owe this life for [F#m]all you've done for [A]us at the [E]cross


{comment: Bridge}
[D]All we [F#m]need is [E]you
