{title: The Look (A379)}
{artist: John Newton, Bob Kauflin}

1. I [Em]saw one hanging on a tree in [C]agony and bl[D]ood
Who [Em]fixed His loving eyes on me as [Am7]near His cross I [Bm7]stood
And [A4]never till my [A]dying breath will [C]I forget that [Bm]look
It [Em]seemed to [D]charge me [C2]with His death though [Bm7]not a word He [A]spoke[C] [D]


{soc}
 For[G]ever [C]etched upon my [Am]mind is the [Em]look of [D6]Him who [C]died 
 The [G/B]Lamb I cruci[Am]fied [D4] [D] 
 And [G]now my [C]life will sing the [Am]praise of [Em]pure a[D6]toning [C]grace 
 That [G/B]looked on me and [Am7]gladly [Bm7]took my [C]place[Am] [C] [Am] 
 (last time: [C]place [D] [E]) 
 {eoc}


2. My [Em]conscience felt and owned the guilt and [C]plunged me in desp[D]air
I [Em]saw my sins His blood had spilt and [Am7]helped to nail Him [Bm7]there
But [A4]with a second [A]look He said I [C]freely all for[Bm]give
This [Em]blood is [D]for your [C2]ransom paid, I [Bm7]died that you might [A]live[C] [D]


3. Thus [Em]while His death my sin displays for [C]all the world to [D]view
Such [Em]is the mystery of grace: it [Am7]seals my pardon [Bm7]too
With [A4]pleasing grief and [A]mournful joy my [C]spirit is now [Bm]filled
That [Em]I should [D]such a [C2]life destroy yet [Bm7]live by Him I [A]killed[C] [D]
