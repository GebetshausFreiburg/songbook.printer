1. [D]  Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
[Gmaj7]  Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
[Bm7]  The King of glory,[A] the King above all [G]kings
[D]  Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder? 
[Gmaj7]  Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
[Bm7]  The King of glory,[A] the King above all [G]kings


{soc}
This is amazing g[D]race, this is unfailing [Gmaj7]love
That You would take my [Bm7]place, that You would bear my [A]cross
You laid down Your [D]life that I would be set [G]free 
Oh,  [Bm7] Jesus, I sing for [A] all that You've done for [G]me
{eoc}


2. [D] Who brings our chaos back into order? 
[Gmaj7]  Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
[Bm7]  The King of glory,[A] the King above all [G]kings
[D]  Who rules the nations with truth and justice,
[Gmaj7]  Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?
[Bm7]  The King of glory,[A] the King above all [G]kings

[D]Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, [Gmaj7]worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[Bm7]Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, [Gmaj7]worthy is the King who conquered the grave
