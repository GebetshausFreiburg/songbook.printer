[Intro] [B] [F#7sus] [G#m] [E]

1. To the cross I [B]look, to the cross I [F#7sus]cling
Of it's suffering I do [G#m]drink, of it's work I do [E]sing
For on it my [B]Savior, both bruised and [F#7sus]crushed
Showed that God is [G#m]love and God is [E]just


{soc}
  [B]At the cross You beckon me 
  [G#m]You draw me gently to my knees 
 And I am[F#7sus]lost for words, so lost in love 
 I'm[E]sweetly broken, wholly surrendered[B] [G#m] [F#7sus] [E] 
 {eoc}


2. What a priceless [B]gift, undeserved [F#7sus]life
Have I been [G#m]given through Christ cruci[E]fied
You've called me out of [B]death, You've called me into [F#7sus]life
And I was under Your [G#m]wrath, now through the cross I'm recon[E]ciled.


{comment: Bridge}
[C#m]In awe of the cross I must con[E]fess
[C#m]How wondrous Your redeeming love and how [E]great is Your faithful[F#]ness
