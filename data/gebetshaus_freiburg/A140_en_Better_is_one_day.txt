{title: Better is one day (A140)}
{artist: Matt Redman}

1. How [E]lovely is your dwelling place,[A2]oh Lord Al[Bsus]mighty
[E]My soul longs and even faints for [Bsus]You
For [E]here my heart is satisfied,[A2]within your [Bsus]presence
I [E]sing beneath the shadow of your [Bsus]wings

{soc}
 Better is [A2]one day in your courts, better is [Bsus]one day in your house 
 Better is [A2]one day in your courts than thousands [Bsus]elsewhere 
 {eoc}


2. One [E]thing I ask and I would seek,[A2]to see your [Bsus]beauty
To [E]find You in the place Your glory [Bsus]dwells


Bridge:
[C#m7]My heart and flesh cry [Bsus]out [A2]for you, the living [Bsus]God
[C#m7]Your spirit's water [Bsus]to my [A2]soul [Bsus]
[C#m7]I've tasted and I've [Bsus]seen, [A2]come once again to me
[E]I will draw near to you, [F#m7]I will draw near to [Bsus]you
