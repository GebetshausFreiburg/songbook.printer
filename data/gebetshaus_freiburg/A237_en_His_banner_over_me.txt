1. He [G]brought me to his banqueting table (echo)
He [G]brought me to his banqueting table (echo)
And his [C]banner over [C]me is [G]love


2. [G]I am my Beloved's and He is mine (echo)
[G]I am my Beloved's and He is mine (echo)
And His [C]banner over [C]me is [G]love
Yes, His [C]banner over [C]me is [G]love [Am7] [G/B] [C2]

{soc}
 We can [G]feel the love of [Am7]God in this place 
 We be[G/B]lieve Your goodness, we re[C2]ceive Your grace 
 We de[G]light ourselves at Your [Am]table, oh God 
 You do [G/B]all things well, just [C2]look at our lives[C2]
