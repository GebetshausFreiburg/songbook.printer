 You can have it [Em/D]all,    L[D]ord 
 Ev'ry part of [Em/B]my [Bm]world 
 Take this life and [G]breathe [Bm]on 
 This [Em7]heart that is now [D]Yours

1. [Bm]Oh the [G]joy I've [D]found sur[Bm]rendering [G]my [D]crowns
At the [Em7]feet [D]of a [A]King who sur[Em7]rendered [D]ev'ryt[A]hing

By Your [Em7]un[D]failing [A]grace I can [Em7]lift my [D]voice and [A]say

[D]I lay it all down, [A]I lay it all down
