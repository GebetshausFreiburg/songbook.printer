 You can have it [Am/G]all,  L[G]ord 
 Ev'ry part of [Am/E]my [Em]world 
 Take this life and [C]breathe [Em]on 
 This [Am7]heart that is now [G]Yours 
 {eoc}


1. [Em]Oh the [C]joy I've [G]found sur[Em]rendering [C]my [G]crowns
At the [Am7]feet [G]of a [D]King who sur[Am7]rendered [G]ev'ryt[D]hing


2. [Em]Oh the [C]peace that [G]comes when I'm [Em]broken [C]and un[G]done
By Your [Am7]un[G]failing [D]grace I can [Am7]lift my [G]voice and [D]say


Bridge:
[C]O-o-o-[Em]oh, [G]o-o-o-[D]oh


[C]There is no greater call [Em]than giving You my [D/F#]all
[G]I lay it all down, [D]I lay it all down
[C]There is no greater love, [Em]no higher name a[D/F#]bove
[G]I lay it all down, [D]I lay it all down
