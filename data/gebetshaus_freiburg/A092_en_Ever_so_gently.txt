{artist: Brian Doerksen, Cindy Rethmeier}

1. [D]Ever so gently your Spirit [C/D]calls to all who [G/D]hear
[D]Ever so gently the sound of Your [C/D]voice quiet yet [G/D]clear
[Em]Day and [D/F#]night from the [G]ends of the [A]earth [Em]the skies [D/F#]pour forth [A]speech
[Em]There‘s no [D/F#]place Your [G]voice isn‘t [A]heard your [G2]patience astounds me

2. [D]Ever so gently I hear Your [C/D]voice pulling me [G/D]near
[D]Ever so gently Your Word of [C/D]life stronger than [G/D]fear
[Em]If I [D/F#]turn a[G]way from Your [A]heart, [Em]try to [D/F#]hide in my [A]shame
[Em]You speak [D/F#]truth in [G]love‘s patient [A]way, Your [G2]gentleness breaks me


{soc}
 Your [D]voice is the [A/C#]sweetest of sounds 
 It's the [Am/C]purest of life giving r[G/B]ain [G] 
 Your [D]voice is the [A/C#]calm in the storm 
 It's the [Am/C]whisper of love that rem[G]ains
