1. [Am]Peace, bring it all to [Fmaj7]peace
The storms surrounding [C]me, let it break [Gsus]at your name
[Am]Still, call the sea to [Fmaj7]still
The rage in me to [C]still, every wave[Gsus]at your name

{soc}
  [Fmaj7]Jesus, Jesus, [C]you make the [Gsus]darkness tremble 
  [Fmaj7]Jesus, Jesus, [Am7]you silence [Gsus]fear 
  [Fmaj7]Jesus, Jesus, [C]you make the [Gsus]darkness tremble 
  [Fmaj7]Jesus, Jes[Am7]us [Gsus] 
 {eoc}


2.[Am]Breathe, call these bones to [Fmaj7]live
Call these lungs to [C]sing; once again,[Em7]I will praise


{comment: Bridge}
Your [F]name is a light that the [C]shadows canâ€™t den[G]y
Your [F]name cann[G]ot be over[Am7]come
Your [F]name is alive [C]forever lifted [G]high
Your [F]name cann[G]ot be over[Am7]come
