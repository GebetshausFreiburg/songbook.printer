1. [E]What can wash a[C#m7]way my sin? [A]Nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus
[E]What can make me [C#m7]whole again? [A]Nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus

  [E]Oh Precious is the flow [B]that makes me white as [E]snow 
  [E]No other [C#m7]fount I know, [A]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus

2. [E]This is all my [C#m7]hope and peace - [A]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus
[E]This is all my [C#m7]righteousness - [A]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus


3. [E]Glory, glory, [C#m7]this I sing]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus
[E]All my praise for [C#m7]this I bring - [A]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus


For my pardon this I see: nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea: nothing but the blood of Jesus


Nothing can for sin atone, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Jesus


Now by this I'll overcome: nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness: nothing but the blod of Jesus
