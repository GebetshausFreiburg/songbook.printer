{title: I Will Offer Up My Life (A171)}
{artist: Matt Redman}

1.[D]I will offer up my l[G]ife in [Asus]spirit and tr[D]uth
Pouring out the oil of l[G]ove as my [Asus]worship to Y[D]ou
In surrender I must g[G]ive my [Asus]every [Bm7]part
Lord, receive the sacrif[G]ice of a br[A]oken h[D]eart

{soc}
 Jesus what can I g[G]ive, [Asus]what can I br[D]ing 
 To so faithful a fr[G]iend, to so [Asus]loving a K[D]ing? 
 Savior what can be s[G]aid, [Asus]what can be s[D]ung 
 As a praise of Your n[G]ame for the [Asus]things You have d[D]one? 
 O my words could not [Em7]tell, not [D/F#]even in p[G]art 
 Of the [Em7]debt of [D/F#]love that is [G]owed by t[A]his thankful h[D]eart 
 {eoc}


2.[D]You deserve my every br[G]eath for You've [Asus]paid the great c[D]ost
Giving up Your life to d[G]eath, even [Asus]death on a cr[D]oss
You took all my shame aw[G]ay, there de[Asus]feated my [Bm7]sin
Opened up the gates of h[G]eaven and have b[A]eckoned me [D]in


[Em7]What can I give, [D/F#]what can I bring,
[G]What can I sing as an offering? [Em7] [D/F#] [G]
