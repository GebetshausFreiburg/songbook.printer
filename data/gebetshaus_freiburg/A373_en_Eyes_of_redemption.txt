1.[G]I'm falling in love with you all [C]over again
'cause there is [Em7]no one who red[D]eems like [Am]you
[G]I'm falling in love with you all [C]over again
You're the [Em7]shepherd who will [D]see me [Am]through

You see my [C]pain through the eyes of red[G]emption
And the [C]sorrow that was mine you t[G]ook away
And you [C]gave me the oil of gladness inst[D]ead

{soc}
 Now I'm [Am]praising your name alw[C]ays, alw[G]ays I [Em7]praise, I [D]praise alw[G]ays [C]

'cause there is [Em7]no one who red[D]eems like [Am]you
[G]I'm falling in love with you all [C]over again
You're the [Em7]shepherd who will [D]see me [Am]through

You give me [C]faith strong enough to move [G]mountains
Until [C]they will be thrown int[G]o the see
And by your [C]power I stand and lift up my [D]hands

 Now I'm [Am]praising your name alw[C]ays, alw[G]ays I [Em7]praise, I [D]praise
