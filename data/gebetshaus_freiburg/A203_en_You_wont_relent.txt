{title: You won't relent (A203)}
{artist: Casandra Campbell, David Brymer, Misty Edwards}


1. [C#m]You won't relent until you [A]have it all
[E]My heart is [F#m]yours


2. I'll [C#m]set you as a [A]seal upon my [E]heart
As a [F#m]seal upon my [C#m]arm
For there is [A]love that is as [E]strong as death
[F#m]Jealousy demanding as the [C#m]grave
And many [A]waters [E]cannot quench this [F#m]love[C#m]

{soc}
  [C#m]Come be the [A]fire inside of [E]me 
 Come be the [F#m]flame upon my [C#m]heart 
 Come be the [A]fire inside of [E]me 
 Until [F#m]you and I are [C#m]one 
 {eoc}


[C#m]All consuming [A]fire, [E]youÂ´re our hearts de[F#m]sire
[C#m]Living flame of [A]love, come baptize [E]us, come baptize [F#m]us


Let us fall more in love with you
We wanna know how high, how deep,
How wide is love, love, love
