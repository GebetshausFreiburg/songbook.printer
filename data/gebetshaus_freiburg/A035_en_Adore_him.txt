1. [Am]It is by gr[F]ace that we are s[C]aved
[Am]Through f[F]aith and not by w[C]orks
[Am]For it is through J[F]esus that we have l[C]ife
[Am]To live is a bl[F]essing, to live is Ch[C]rist


{soc}
 C[Am]ome, let [Fmaj7]us ad[C]ore Him 
 C[Am]ome, let [Fmaj7]us ad[C]ore Him 
  [Am]O-o-[F]oh a[C]dore Him 
  [Am]O-o-[F]oh a[C]dore Him 
 {eoc}


2. [Am]So we've been r[F]aised with Jesus Ch[C]rist
[Am]Let's set our h[F]earts on things ab[C]ove
[Am]That we may be f[F]illed with the fullness of G[C]od
[Am]And walk in the fr[F]eedom He's given us[C]


Bridge:
[F]To our God, [G]to our Father
[Am]Be the glory, [C]forever and [Csus]ever
