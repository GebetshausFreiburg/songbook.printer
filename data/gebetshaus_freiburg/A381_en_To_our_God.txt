{title: To our God (A381)}
{artist: Brian Johnson, Jeremy Riddle, Joel Taylor}

1. [Bm]Up from the [G]ashes Your love has b[D]rought us
Out of the [A]darkness into the [Bm]light
Lifting our [G]sorrows, bearing our [D]burdens, healing our [A]hearts


{soc}
  [Bm]To our God we lift up one voice[G], to our God we lift up one song 
  [D]To our God we lift up one voice,[A]singing Hallelujah 
 {eoc}


2. [Bm]Chains have been br[G]oken, eyes have been [D]opened
An army of d[A]ry bones is starting to [Bm]rise
Death is def[G]eated, we are vict[D]orious for You are a[A]live


Hallelu[G]jah, hallelu[A]jah (repeat)



Bridge:
Make His p[Bm]raise glori[G]ous, glori[D]ous, glori[A]ous
For His [Bm]name is glori[G]ous, glori[D]ous, glor[A]ious
Make His p[Bm]raise glori[G]ous, glori[D]ous, glori[A]ous
Shout His [Bm]name: glori[G]ous, glori[D]ous, glori[A]ous
