1. A thousand t[F]imes I've failed, still your m[C]ercy rem[G]ains.
And should I st[F]umble again, still I'm c[C]aught in your gr[G]ace.
Everl[Am]asting, Your l[F]ight will shine when [C]all else f[G]ades.
Never [Am]ending, Your gl[F]ory goes bey[C]ond all f[G]ame.[F] [C] [G] [F] [C] [G]


2. Your will ab[F]ove all else, my p[C]urpose rem[G]ains.
The art of l[F]osing myself in br[C]inging you pr[G]aise.
Everl[Am]asting, Your l[F]ight will shine when [C]all else f[G]ades.
Never [Am]ending, Your gl[F]ory goes bey[C]ond all f[G]ame.

 1. Chorus: [F]In my heart, in my s[C]oul, Lord I give you contr[Am]ol. 
 Consume me from the [G]inside out Lord. 
  [F]Let justice and pr[Am]aise become my embr[G]ace 
 To love You from the [Dm]inside out. 
 2. Chorus: Everl[Am]asting, Your l[F]ight will shine when [C]all else f[G]ades. 
 Never [Am]ending, Your gl[F]ory goes bey[C]ond all f[G]ame. 
 And the cry[C]of my hea[F]rt is to brin[G]g You pr[Am]aise 
 From the [F]inside [G]out, Lord, my so[F]ul cries [G]out.
