{soc}
 Lord, I [C/E]know that Your eyes are like flames of fire 
 I [Gsus]know that Your head is white as [C/E]wool 
 And I [F2]know that Your voice, it sounds like [C/E]waters 
  [Dm7]Jesus, You’re [C]beautiful 
 {eoc}


1. [C/G]Spirit of wisdom, [F2/A]open my eyes again
[C/G]Spirit of revelation, [F2/A]open my heart again
’Cause [C/G]I [Cmaj7/G]want to [F2/A]see
Lord, [C/G]I [Cmaj7/G]want to [F2/A]see, see You rightly, Jesus

[C/E]There is [Gsus]none [C/E]like [F2]You, Lord[C/E]- [Dm7]Jesus, You’re [C]beautiful


{comment: Bridge 2:}
[C/E]There is no one like You in the [Gsus]heavens or on the earth[C/E]
[F2]There is no one like You [C/E]in the [Dm7]heavens or on [C]the earth
