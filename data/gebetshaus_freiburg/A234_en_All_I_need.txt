{artist: Kevin Prosch}

1.[E]I dreamed of a [A]town that's built for [E]souls.[E]Lots of [A]silver, streets of [E]gold
[A]And there [F#m]are no homeless [E]there, for [F#]everyone that's [A]there has a [E]home


2.[E]There will be [A]justice in this [E]land.[E]Those valleys and [A]rocks have not yet [E]heared
[A]And the [F#m]cry of the poor will [E]cease, for [F#]everyone is [A]rich, we have [E]You


{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[G]And the [C]floods, the clear clean f[D]lood [G]that gushes [C]from that throne of [D]gold
[G]And the water of [C]life it's free to [D]drink, [G]and it's [C]worth the waiting [D]for[E] [E] [A] [F#m] [E]


{soc}
 You're [E]all I need to get [A]by. You're [F#m]all I need to get [E]high. 
 {eoc}


3.[E]You change my [A]heart, this heart of [E]stone [E]became the [A]anchor of my [E]thoughts
[A]And when [F#m]pain won't go aw[E]ay, I [F#]feel Your presence [A]now, You touch my [E]soul


4.[E]As the painter's [A]brush consumes his [E]dreams, [E]I've made my [A]choice to follow [E]You
[A]For me to live, yes, this is [E]Christ [F#]and for me to [A]die this is my [E]gain


{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[G]I live by [C]faith in the Son of [D]God,[G]but there are [C]times when I have my [D]doubts
[G]I do not reg[C]ret the things I've [D]lost,[G]for compared to [C]You what have I [D]lost?[E]


Lover of my soul. Creator of a clean heart.
Oh lover of my soul, look what You've done for me.
Oh the recklessness of Your Mercy. Oh the recklessness of Your mercy, God.
