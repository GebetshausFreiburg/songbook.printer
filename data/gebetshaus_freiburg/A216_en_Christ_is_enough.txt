{title: Christ is enough (A216)}
{artist: Reuben Morgan, Thomas Myrin}


1.[Em]Christ is my rew[C]ard and all of my dev[G]otion[D/F#]
Now there's [Em]nothing in this [C]world that could ever satis[G]fy [D/F#]
Through [Bm]ev'ry [C]trial my [D]soul will [Em]sing
No [G/B]turning [C]back, I've [Em]been set [D]free

{soc}
  [G]Christ is e[Gsus]nough [G]for me. [Em7]Christ is enough for [D]me[C] 
 Ev'rything I [D]need is [Em]in you, [C]ev'rything I[D]need 
 {eoc}


2.[Em]Christ my all in [C]all the joy of my salv[G]ation [D/F#]
And this [Em]hope will never [C]fail heaven is our [G]home [D/F#]
Through [Bm]ev'ry [C]storm my [D]soul will [Em]sing
Je[G/B]sus is [C]here to God be the [Em]glo[D]ry


{comment: Bridge}
I have de[Em]cid[C]ed to follow [D]Je[Em]sus
No turning [C]back,[Em]no turning [D]back
I have de[Em]cid[C]ed to follow [D]Je[Em]sus
No turning [C]back, no [D]turning [G]back


The cross be[Em]fore m[C]e, the world be[D]hind m[Em]e
No turning [C]back,[Em]no turning [D]back
The cross be[Em]fore m[C]e, the world be[D]hind m[Em]e
No turning [C]back, no [D]turning [G]back
