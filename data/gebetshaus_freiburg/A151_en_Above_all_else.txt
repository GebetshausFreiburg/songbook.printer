1. [D2]Jesus, my passion in life is to [Bm]know You.
May all other goals bow [Em]down [D/F#]to
This [G]journey of [Asus]loving You [D2]more.
[D2]Jesus, You've showered Your goodness [Bm]on me,
Given Your gifts so [Em]free[D/F#]ly,
But [G]there's one thing [Asus]I'm longing [D2]for.


{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[Em7]Hear my heart's [D/F#]cry
And my [G]prayer for this [Asus]life.

{soc}
  [G]Above all [D2/F#]else, [Em7]above all [Asus]else 
  [G]Above all [D2/F#]else [Em7]give [Asus]me Your[D2]self. 
 {eoc}


2. [D2]Savior, the more that I see Your [Bm]beauty
The more that I glimpse Your [Em]glo[D/F#]ry
[G]My heart is [Asus]captured by [D2]You.
[D2]Jesus, You are my greatest [Bm]treasure
Nothing this world can [Em]off[D/F#]er
Could [G]ever com[Asus]pare to [D2]You.
