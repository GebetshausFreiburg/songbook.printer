{title: You know me (A098)}
{artist: Steffany Frizzel Gretzinger, William Matthews}

You have [Dm7]been,[C4]and You will [F2/A]be [Bb2]
You have [Dm7]seen,[C4]and You will [F2/A]see [Bb2]

Pre-Chorus: [Dm7]You know [C4]when I [Bbmaj7]rise and when I [Dm7]fall
When I [C4]come or [Bbmaj7]go, You see it [Dm7]all
You [C4]hung the [Bbmaj7]stars, and You move the [Csus]sea [C]
And still You know me

{soc}
 (Wh[F]oa) oh oh [Bbmaj7]oh,  oh oh [F/A]oh,  oh oh [Bbmaj7]oh, You know me 
 Wh[F]oa oh oh [Bbmaj7]oh,  oh oh [F/A]oh,  oh[Bbmaj7](You know me) 
 {eoc}


Bridge: [F2]Nothing is [Bbmaj7]hidden from Your [F2]sight
Wherever I [Bbmaj7]go, You find me
[F2]You know every [Bbmaj7]detail of my [F2]life
You are [Bbmaj7]God and You don't miss a [F2]thing
