{artist: Third Day}

Your [G]love, oh Lord, [C]reaches to the h[G]eavens.[D]
Your [Em]faithfulness [C]stretches to the [G]sky,[D]
Your [Em]righteousness [C]is like the mighty [G]mountain, [D]yeah.
Your [Em]justice flows [C]like the ocean's [G]tide.


{soc}
 I will lift my [D]voice 
 to [C]worship You, my [G]King. 
 I will find my [D]strength 
 in the sh[C]adow of Your [Am7]wings.[D]
