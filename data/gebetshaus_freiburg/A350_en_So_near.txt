1. You're [G]here, I'm not a[Bm7]lone
There is [G]peace in my [Bm7]soul
I find [G]rest in Your [Bm7]love
I give it [G]all, I give it [Bm7]up


{soc}
 So [D]near, so [Bm7]near 
 So [D]near, so [Bm7]near 
 Take my [G]life, take my [D]all 
 Take my [G]love and make me [D]Yours 
 {eoc}


2. You're [G]here, You are [Bm7]mine
In this [G]beauty I am [Bm7]high
And I'm [G]new, I'm breaking [Bm7]free
This is so a[G]mazing, I want to [Bm7]see
