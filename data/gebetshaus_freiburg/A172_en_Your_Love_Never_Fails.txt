{artist: Anthony Skinner, Chris McClarney}

1.[C#m]Nothing can [A]separate [E]even if I [B]run away
[C#m]Your love never fa[A]ils [E] [B]
[C#m]I know I still m[A]ake mistakes
But [E]You have new mercy for me [B]everyday
[C#m]Your love never fa[A]ils [E] [B]

{soc}
  [A]You stay the [E]same through the ages [B] 
  [F#m]Your love never ch[A]anges 
 There may be p[E]ain in the night 
 But [B]joy comes in the [F#m]morning 
  [A]And [E]when the oceans [B]rage 
 I don't [F#m]have to be afra[A]id 
 Because I [E]know that you love me [B] 
 And [F#m]your love never f[A]ails [C#m] [B] 
 {eoc}


2. The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
Cause your love never fails the chasm was far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side but your love never fails

{comment: Bridge}
You make [A]all things [C#m]work together for my[B]good
