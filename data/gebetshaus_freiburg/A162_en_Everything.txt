1. God in my [C]living, there in my [Fmaj7]breathing.
God in my [Am]waking, God in my [G6]sleeping.
God in my [C]resting, there in my [Fmaj7]working.
God in my [Am]thinking, God in my [G6]speaking.

{soc}
 Be my ev[Fmaj7]erything[G], be my ev[Am]erything[G]. 
 Be my ev[Fmaj7]erything[G], be my ever[C]ything. 
 {eoc}


2. God in my [C]hoping, there in my [Fmaj7]dreaming.
God in my [Am]watching, God in my [G6]waiting.
God in my [C]laughing, there in my [Fmaj7]weeping.
God in my [Am]hurting, God in my [G6]healing.


{comment: Bridge}
[F]Christ in me,[G]Christ in me
[Am]Christ in me the hope of glory.
[F]Y[G]ou are every[Am]thing.
[F]Christ in me,[G]Christ in me
[Am]Christ in me the hope of glory.
[F]B[G]e my every[Am]thing.
