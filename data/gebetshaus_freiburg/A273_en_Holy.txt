[Dm]Here we are, God, [Gm] come before the throne of [F]grace. [Am]
[Dm]Here we are, God, [Gm]  come before the mercy [F]seat. [Am]

I can see the [Dm]lightning, I can feel the [Gm]thunder.
I can hear the [F]voices proceeding from your [Am]throne.

Twenty-four [Dm]elders bowing low,[Gm]
Casting [F]down their crowns of gold. [Am]
And four living [Dm]creatures crying out,[Gm]
Day and [F]night, night and [Am]day.

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
Only [Dm]one word comes to [Gm]mind.
There's only [F]one word to de[Am]scribe.

{soc}
  [Dm]  Holy,[Gm]  holy, [F]  Lord God Al[Am]mighty. 
 {eoc}


{comment: Bridge}
[Dm]There is no one [Gm]like you.
Your are [F]holy, holy.[Am]
