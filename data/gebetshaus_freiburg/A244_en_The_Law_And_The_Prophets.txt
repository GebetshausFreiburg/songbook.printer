{artist: Luke Wood}

1. [Am]Though I speak with the [C]tongues of men and [G]angels
[Am]Though I have the [C]faith to move the m[G]ountains
[Am]If I don't have [C]love, [G]what have I? [Am]If I don't have [C]love, [G]what have I?


2. [Am]What is sown in [C]love will never be [G]taken away
For [Am]love is the [C]currency of heaven for[G]ever
[Am]If I don't have [C]love, [G]what have I? [Am]If I don't have [C]love, [G]what have I?

{soc}
 All the [F]law and the prophets, [Am]they hang on [G]love 
 And that's what [G]holds it all together 
 And [F]love will [Am]never fall aw[G]ay 
 {eoc}

[F]Love[Am]is the very [G]flame of God (repeat)

[F]Many waters [Am]cannot quench lo[G]ve (repeat)
