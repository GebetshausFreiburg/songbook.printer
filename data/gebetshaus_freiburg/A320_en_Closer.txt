key: D

1. Your [Bm]love has ravished my [A]heart
And taken me [D/F#]over, taken me [G]over
And [Bm]all I want is to [A]be
With you for[D/F#]ever, with you for[G]ever


{soc}
 [D]  Pull me a little [A/C#]closer, take me a little [Bm]deeper 
 I want to know your [G]heart, I want to know your [D]heart 
 'Cause your love is so much [A/C#]sweeter than anything I've [Bm]tasted 
 I want to know your [G]heart, I want to know your [D]heart 
 {eoc}

[G]  Who[D]a, who[A]a, how great your [Bm]love is for me
[G]  Who[D]a, who[A]a, how great is [Bm]your love
