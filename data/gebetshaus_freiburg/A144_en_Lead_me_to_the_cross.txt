1.[Bm]Savior I c[A6]ome, quiet my [G]soul, rem[D]emb[A]er
[Bm]Redemptions [A6]hill where Your blood was [G]spilled
For my [D]rans[A]om


Prechorus:
[Em7]Everything I [A]once held dear, I [Bm]count it [A]all as [G]loss

{soc}
 Lead me to the [G]cross where Your [D]love poured [A]out 
 Bring me to my [G]knees, Lord I [D]lay me [A]down 
 Rid me of mys[G]elf I bel[D]ong to [A]You 
 Oh, lead m[Em9]e, [G]lead me [A]to the [Bm]cross 
 {eoc}



2.[Bm]You were as [A6]I, tempted and tr[G]ied, [D]hum[A]an
[Bm]The word became [A6]flesh, bore my sin in [G]death
Now you're [D]ris[A]en


Bridge:
To your [D]he[G]art[A],   to your [D]he[G]art[A]
Lead me to your [D]he[G]art[A],   lead me to your [D]he[G]art[A]
