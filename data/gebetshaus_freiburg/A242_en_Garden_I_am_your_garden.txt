1.(Here it's) [Am]You and me al[Fmaj7]one God, [Em7]You and me al[Fmaj7]one
Here it's [Am]You and me al[Fmaj7]one God, [Em7]You and me al[Fmaj7]one

{soc}
 You've hedged me [Am]in with [Fmaj7]skin all a[Em7]round [Fmaj7]me 
 I'm a garden en[Am]closed a locked [Fmaj7]garden 
  [Em7]Life takes place be[Fmaj7]hind the face 
 {eoc}


Bridge 1:
So [Am]come into Your garden, [Fmaj7]come into Your garden
[Em7]Come into Your garden, [Fmaj7]come into Your garden

{soc}
  [Am]I'm no [F]longer my [G]own I'm Your [Am]garden 
 {eoc}


Bridge 2: I don't want to [Am]waste my life living on the [F]outside
I'm going to [G]live from the inside [Am]out (2x)


There’s a place wit[Am]hin where [Fmaj7]no man can go in the secret [Em7]reservoir of the [Fmaj7]soul
In Your jealou[Am]sy you’ve cr[Fmaj7]eated me as a garden enc[Em7]losed for You a[Fmaj7]lone
There’s a world in[Am]side more [Fmaj7]real than meets the eye re[Em7]served for your [Fmaj7]home
In your jealou[Am]sy you’ve cr[Fmaj7]eated me like a shoreless [Em7]ocean in[Fmaj7]side
