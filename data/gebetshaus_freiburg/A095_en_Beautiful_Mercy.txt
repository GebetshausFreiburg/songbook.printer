1. There is no [D]pit too [D/C#]deep
That [Bm]Jesus cannot reach
There is no [Em9]sorrow so strong
That would [G/A]overtake his be[A]loved one

{soc}
 And He's brought me to the [D]wilderness 
 Where [F#m]I will learn to [G]sing 
 And He [Em]lets me know my [Bm]barrenness 
 So [F#m]I will learn to [G]lean 
 {eoc}


Bridge 1: Beautiful [Bm]Mercy,
[F#m]Do what you have to [G]do
Jealous [Bm]Lover
[F#m]Do what you have to [G]do


Bridge 2: So I will [A/B]sing ...[Bm] [A/B]even in my [Bm]barrenness
I will [A/B]sing ...[Bm] [A/B]even in this [Bm]brokenness
I will [A/B]sing ...[Bm] [A/B]even in this [Bm]loneliness
