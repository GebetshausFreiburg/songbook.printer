1. [D]  All my hands have made I'm lay[D/F#]ing [G]down
[D]  All that I hold dear my ma[D/F#]ny [G]crowns
[D]  I have tasted and seen of Your [D/F#]great [G]love
You satis[Bm]fy me, You satis[A6sus4]fy me



{soc}
 Spirit [D]fall, open up heaven's [Asus]doors
 We're waiting with worship for [Bm]more 
 You're the [G]only love that satis[Asus]fies me 
 Lord we [D]run into Your loving [Asus]arms
 We’re safe and secure in Your [Bm]love 
 You’re the [G]only love that satis[Asus]fies me 
 {eoc}



2. [D]  My constant request above [D/F#]all [G]things
[D]  Every hour I wake be [D/F#]near [G]me, oh God
[D]  Though I've tasted and seen of Your [D/F#]great [G]love
Show me Your [Bm]glory, show me Your [A6sus4]glory


{comment: Bridge:}
Leave me ast[D]ounded, leave me a[G]mazed
Show off Your [Bm]glory, let heaven in[Asus]vade
We're waiting with [D]worship, we're waiting with [G]praise
For the almighty [Bm]presence of God to in[Asus]vade
