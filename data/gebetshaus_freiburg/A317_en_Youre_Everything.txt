1. [A]  You're every[D2]thing I co[A/C#]uld  want, that I could [D2]need
[A]  If I could [D2] see You w[A/C#]ant me could I be[D2]lieve?

2. [A] 'Cause You're perfect[D2]ly all I [A/C#] want, all I [D2]need
[A]  If I co[D2]uld just feel Y[A/C#]our touch could I be [D2]free?


{comment: Pre-Chorus 1:}
[A/C#]  Why do You shine so? [D2]  Can a blind man see?
[A/C#] Why do You call? Why [D2]  do You beckon me? 
[A]  Can the deaf [Amaj7]hear the voice of [Esus/B]love?
Would You have me come? Can the cripple [A/C#]run? Are You the [D2]one?


{soc}
 To [A]raise me up [A/C#]from this grave, [D]touch my tongue and then I'll sing
  [A]Heal my limbs, then [A/C#]joyfully I'll [D]run to You (x2) 
 {eoc}


2. [A]  You’re every[D2]thing I co[A/C#]uld want, that I could [D2]need
[A]  And I c[D2]an just feel Y[A/C#]our touch and I can’t [D2]breathe


{comment: Pre-Chorus 2:}
[A/C#]  Look how You shine, so [D]  the blind can see,
[A/C#] And how You call, how [D]  You beckon me
[A] The deaf [Amaj7]hear the voice of [Esus/B]love
You bid me come, and the cripple [A/C#]run, oh you’re the [D2]one

{comment: Bridge:} 
[A]     [A/C#]  'Cause You're every[D2]thing
[A]     [A/C#]    You're every[D2]thing

{comment: Ending:}
[A]  And I'm al[D2]ive and I'll sing
[A/C#]  And I'm al[D2]ive and I'm free
