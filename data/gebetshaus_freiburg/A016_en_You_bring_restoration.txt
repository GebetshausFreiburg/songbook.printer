{artist: David Brymer}

You've taken my [E]pain
called me by a [G#m]new name
You've taken my sh[A]ame
and in it's [E/G#]place, You give me [H]joy

{soc}
 You bring restor[E]ation 
 You bring restor[H]ation 
 You bring restor[A]ation [C#m]to my [H]soul 
 {eoc}


[E]You take my mourning and turn it into dancing
[G#m]You take my weeping and turn it into laughing
[A]You take my mourning and [E/G#]turn it into dancing
[H]You take my sadness and turn it into joy


Halle[A/E]lu - j[E]ah, Halle[A/E]lu - j[E]ah
You make [H]all things new, all things new (2x)
