[E]  You take my mourning and turn it into dancing
[G#m]  You take my weeping and turn it into laughing
[A]  You take my mourning and turn it into dancing
[B]  You take my sadness and turn it into joy


Halle[A/E]lu - j[E]ah, Halle[A/E]lu - j[E]ah
You make [B]all things new, all things new (2x)
