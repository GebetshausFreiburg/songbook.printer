{title: Pour my Love on You (A207)}
{artist: Dan Dean, Gary Sadler}

[C]I [G/B]don't know h[F]ow to say exactly how I f[C]eel
And I [G/B]can't beg[F]in to tell you what your l[G]ove has m[Am]eant
I'm l[G]ost for w[F]ords
[C]Is [G/B]there a w[F]ay to show the passion in my h[C]eart
Can [G/B]I exp[F]ress how truly great I th[G]ink you [Am]are
My [G]dearest f[F]riend


Prechorus:
[Dm]Lord [C/E]this is my des[Gsus]ire[G]
[Dm]To [C/E]pour my love on [Gsus]you

{soc}
 Like [G]oil upon your [C]feet, like wine for you to [F2]drink 
 Like water from my [Am]heart I pour my love on [Gsus]you 
 If praise is like per[C/E]fume I'll lavish mine on [F2]you 
 Till every drop is [Am]gone I'll pour my [Gsus]love [G]on [F]you 
 {eoc}
