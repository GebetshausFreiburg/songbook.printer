1.[C]  You were the Word at the beginning, one with [F]God the [Am]Lord Most [G]High
[Am]  Your hidden [G]glory in crea[C]tion now re[F]vealed in [Am]You our [G]Christ

{soc}
 What a beautiful Name it [C]is, what a beautiful Name it [G]is, the Name of [Am]Jesus [G]Christ my [F]King 
 What a beautiful Name it [C]is, nothing compares to [G]this 
 What a beautiful Name it [Am]is, the [G]Name of [F]Jesus 
 {eoc}


2.[C]  You didn't want heaven without us, so Jesus [F]You brought [Am]heaven [G]down
[Am]  My sin was [G]great, Your love was [C]greater. What could [F]sepa[Am]rate us [G]now?

 What a wonderful Name it [C]is, what a wonderful Name it [G]is, the Name of [Am]Jesus [G]Christ my [F]King 
 What a wonderful Name it [C]is, nothing compares to [G]this 
 What a wonderful Name it [Am]is, the [G]Name of [F]Jesus 
 What a wonderful Name it [Am]is, the [G]Name of [F]Jesus

Bridge:
Death could not [F]hold You, the veil tore be[G]fore You, You silence the [Am]boast of sin and [Em]grave
The heavens are [F]roaring the praise of Your [G]glory, for You are [Am]raised to life a[G]gain


You have no [F]rival, You have no [G]equal, now and for[Am]ever God You [Em]reign
Yours is the [F]kingdom, Yours is the [G]glory, Yours is the [Am]Name above all [G]names

{soc}
 What a powerful Name it [C]is, what a powerful Name it [G]is, the Name of [Am]Jesus [G]Christ my [F]King 
 What a powerful Name it [C]is, nothing can stand a[G]gainst 
 What a powerful Name it [Am]is, the [G]Name of [F]Jesus 
 {eoc}
