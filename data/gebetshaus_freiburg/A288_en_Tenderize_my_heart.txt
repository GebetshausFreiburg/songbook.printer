The de[C#m]sire of my [Bm]soul is [C#m]for Your name o [Dmaj7]Lord
I will [E]wait for You un[D/F#]til you come and [E/G#]tenderize my [E/D]heart
The re[C#m]memberance of [Bm]You re[C#m]sounds within my [Dmaj7]soul
In the [E]way of Your judgements [D/F#]I will seek You - [E/G#]I will wait


{soc}
 And You will [F#m]tender[Bm]ize my [Esus]heart [E] 
 You will [F#m]tender[Bm]ize my [Esus]heart [E] 
 I will [F#m]feel as You [D]feel - I will [A]love as You [Bm]love 
 I will [F#m]see as You [D]see - I will [A]speak as You [Bm]speak 
 Come and [D/F#]tender[E/G#]ize my [A/C#]heart 
 Let me [D]see You [E]as You [Asus]are [A] 
 {eoc}


I will sing out [C#m]loud for the majesty of my [Bm]Lord
I proclaim and de[C#m]clare the name of my [D]God
From the womb of the [E]morning and the ends of the [D]earth
I hear songs of ador[E]ation to the righteous one
