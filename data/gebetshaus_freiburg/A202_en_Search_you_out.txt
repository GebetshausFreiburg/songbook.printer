[Em]I don't under[C]stand the depths of [D4]who you [D]are
But it's [Em]all my joy to [C]spend a lifetime [D4]searching you [D]out
Cause [Em]hidden in your [C]heart is all [D4]myster[D]y
Of [Em]knowledge and [C]wisdom and [D4]glor[D]y

{soc}
 I will [Em]search you [C]out[D4] [D](repeat) 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
[Em]I'm seeking you [C]as a precious [D]jewel
Lord, to give [D/B]up I'd be a [Em]fool
