{title: All Is for Your Glory (A189)}
{artist: Lisa Gottshall, Laura Hackett}

1. There’s [Bb6]just one chief end to man’s purpose [Bb]
[Bb6]One main reason for existence [Bb]
[Bb6]All man’s vain and high ambitions [Bb]
Will [Cm]one day be brought [Gm]low, will [Cm]one day be brought [Bb]low


2. To [Bb6]treasure You above all others [Bb]
To [Bb6]love You like we love no other [Bb]
Your [Bb6]greatness soon will be uncovered [Bb]
And [Cm]all the earth will then [Gm]know, and [Cm]all the earth will then [Bb]know


Pre-Chorus:
For [Cm]You alone will [Bb/D]be exalted [Fsus]in that day[F]
[Cm]Worthless goals will [Bb6]be exposed as [F/A]idols that we’ve [F]made
[Cm]For You alone will [Bb/D]be exalted [Fsus]in that day[F]
[Cm]You’ll be seen as [Bb6]rightful King, and [F/A]from our hearts we’ll [F]say that


{soc}
  [Eb/G]All is for Your [Bb/F]glory, [Eb/G]all is for Your [Bb/F]name, [Eb/G]all is for Your [Bb/F]glory 
 That in [Eb]all things You may have [Bb/D]first place 
 That in [Eb/G]all things You may have pre-[Fsus]eminence[F] 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
So put me [Eb]anywhere, just put Your [Bb/D]glory in me
I’ll serve [Eb/G]anywhere, just let me see your [Bb/F]beauty [F]


Tag:
Catch me [Eb/G]up in Your story, all my [Bb/F]life for Your glory (repeat)


My God, my [Eb/G]joy, my de[Bb/F]light (repeat)
