{title: Make your home in me (A026)}
{artist: Helen Frye, Michael Frye}

1. [D]I have sung my songs of praise, thanksgiving on my lips
Bowed [G]down and worshipped [F#m]you
But [D]now I'm coming close, closer than before
For the [G]veil is torn in [A]two


{soc}
  [Bm]Now that [A]I am [G]here with [A]you 
 there's no [Bm]place I'd [A]rather [G]be 
  [Bm]Now that [A]I have [G]felt your [A]touch 
  [Bm]Make your [A]home in [G]me 
 {eoc}



2. I feel so safe with you, acceptance in your voice
You whisper tenderly
You are my beloved, chosen one my friend
You're so precious to me
