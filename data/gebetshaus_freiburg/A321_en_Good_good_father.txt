{artist: Patt Barrett, Anthony Brown}

1. [G]I've heard a [Gsus]thousand [G5]stories of [G]what they [Gsus]think You`re [G5]like
But [G]I`ve heard a [Gsus]tender [G5]whisper of [G]love in the [Gsus]dead of [G5]night
You [C2]tell me [G/B]that You`re pleased and that [Am7]I`m never a[D4]lone


{soc}
 You`re a good, good [C2]father, it`s who You are, [G] 
 it`s who You are [Am7], it`s who You are [D4] 
 And I`m loved by [C2]You, it`s who I am, [G] 
 it's who I am [Am7], it`s who I am [D4] 
 {eoc}



2. [G]I`ve seen [Gsus]many [G5]searching for [G]answers [Gsus]far and [G5]wide
But [G]I know [Gsus]we`re all [G5]searching for [G]answers only [Gsus]You pro[G5]vide
Because You [C2]know just [G/B]what we need before [Am7]we say a [D4]word


{comment: Bridge:}
You are [C2]perfect in all of your [Em7]ways
You are [Am7]perfect in all of your [G]ways
You are [C2]perfect in all of your [Em7]ways to [D4]us


3. [G]Love so [Gsus]unde[G5]niable [G]I can [Gsus]hardly [G5]speak.
[G]Peace so [Gsus]unex[G5]plainable [G]I can [Gsus]hardly [G5]think
As You [C2]call me [G/B]deeper still, as You [Am7]call me [G/B]deeper still
As You [C2]call me [G/B]deeper still into [Am7]love love [D4]love
