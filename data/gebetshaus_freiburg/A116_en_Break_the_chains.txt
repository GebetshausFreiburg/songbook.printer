{title: Break the chains (A116)}
{artist: Misty Edwards}

Come break the [Bm]chains, the [G]chains that [A]hinder love,
All that [Bm]remains of [G]yester-[A]year.
Come break the [Bm]chains, the [G]chains that [A]pull me down,
Come break the [Bm]chains and [G]draw me [A]near.

{soc}
 And let Your [Bm]fire [G]burn con[A]suming me, 
 Let Your [Bm]jealous [G]flame come [A]take away everything. 
 Let Your [Bm]fire [G]burn con[A]suming me, 
 Let Your [Bm]jealous [G]flame come and [A]write your name upon my [G]heart. 
 Until all that re[A]mains is the [G]light of Your counten[A]ance. 
 And I will be [G]satisfied when I aw[A]aken, as a lover of [Bm]You.[G] [A]

Bridge:[Bm] [G]Who is t[A]his, garment stained [Bm]red,
[G]who is t[A]his, crowns on His [Bm]head?
[G]Who is t[A]his running like a [Bm]lion, [G]who is t[A]his He’s roaring from [Bm]Zion,[G] [A]
He’s roaring from [Bm]Zion[G] [A]
Who [Bm]is this King of [G]Glory,[A](3X)
He’s mighty to [Bm]save all who [G]call on His [A]name,
In righteous[Bm]ness He is [G]mighty to [A]save.
He’s mighty to [Bm]save all who [G]call on His [A]name.


[Bm]Woe to the enemy[G] [A]of the [Bm]King on His wedding day[G] [A](Line 2x)
I love Your [Bm]judgements,[G] [A]just and [Bm]true.[G] [A]
