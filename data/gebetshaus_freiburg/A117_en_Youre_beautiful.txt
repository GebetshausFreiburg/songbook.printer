{title: You're beautiful (A117)}
{artist: Phil Wickham}

1. [D]I see Your face in [G]every sunrise
The [Bm]colors of the morning are in[A]side Your eyes
[D]The world awakens in the [G]light of the day
I [Bm]look up to the sky and [A]say: You're beautiful
[D]Oh.[G].. [Bm]Oh.[A].. You’re beautiful


2. I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
It’s all proclaiming who You are
You’re beautiful, You're beautiful

3. I see you there hanging on a tree
You bled and then you died
and then you rose again for me
Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home
You’re beautiful, you're beautiful

4. When we arrive at eternity’s shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
We’ll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we’ll sing
You’re beautiful, You're beautiful, You're beautiful
