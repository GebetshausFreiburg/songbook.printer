1. [Em]We come to your [C2]mountain,
[Em]The hill of the [C2]Lord; we [D/F#]would as[Em]cend,
And journey in[C2]to  Your [D/F#]holy place[Em].
2. [Em]To feast in Your [C2]presence, [Em]and bring our de[C2]votions [D/F#]to You, [Em]God;
We come as a king[C2]dom [D/F#]of Your [Em]priests.

{soc}
 We're climbing up the [Am]mountain of the Lord, 
 To[Am/G]wards  Your  holy  place, And [Am/F]every  step  is  praise. 
 En[Am/G]countering  the [Am]glory  of  Your  name, 
 Your [Am/G]throne  of  holiness,  The [Am/F#]wonders  of  Your  grace. 
 {eoc}


3. [Em]We enter Your [C2]sanctuary,
[Em]To minister [C2]at Your [D/F#]holy th[Em]rone,
Where thousands of [C2]angels j[D/F#]oyfully [Em]sing.


Bridge:
Oh [Em]come, come let us w[G]orship,
Come let us [A7/C#]recognize what a s[C]acred [D/F#]thing we [Em]do.
Come, let us [G]bow down, God;
As we [A7/C#]bring our hearts, let them [C]please the [D/F#]heart of [Em]You.ï»¿
