1. [C]  There's nothing worth more that will ever come [Fmaj7]close
No thing can compare, you're our living [C]hope, Your presence[Fmaj7]


2. [C]  I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of [Fmaj7]loves
where my heart becomes free and my shame is un[C]done - in Your presence, [Fmaj7]Lord


{soc}
 [C]Holy Spirit you are welcome here 
 Come [Fmaj7]flood this place and fill the [Dm7]atmosphere 
 Your [C]glory God is what our hearts long for 
 To be [Fmaj7]overcome by your [Dm7]presence Lord[C]
