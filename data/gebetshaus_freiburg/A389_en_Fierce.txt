1. Before I [C2]call, before I ever [G]cry 
You answer [Em]me from where the thunder [Dsus]hides 
I can't out[C2]run this heart I’m tethered [G]to 
With every [Em]step I collide with [Dsus]You 
 
 
{soc}
  [C2]Like a tidal wave[G]  crashing over me[Em7]  rushing in to meet me [Dsus]here 
 Your love is [C2]fierce! 
 Like a hurricane[G]  that I can’t escape[Em7]  tearing through the atmos[Dsus]phere 
 Your love is [C2]fierce! 
 {eoc}
 
 
2. You cannot [C2]fail, the only thing I’ve [G]found 
Is through it [Em]all You never let me [Dsus]down 
You don’t hold [C2]back, relentless in pur[G]suit 
At every [Em]turn I come face to face with [Dsus]You 
 
 
 
{comment: Bridge:}
[C2]You chase me down, You seek me out 
[Em7]How could I be [D]lost when You have called me found?
