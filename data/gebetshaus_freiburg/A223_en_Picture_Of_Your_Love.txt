{title: Picture Of Your Love (A223)}
{artist: Luke Wood}

1. [Dm]Your [C]love is the [G/B]rock that I [Dm]cling t[C]o [G/B]
[Dm]Your [C]name is the [G/B]tower that I run [Dm]int[C]o [G/B]
[Dm]Your str[C]ength is what [G/B]lifts my head when it's [Dm]bowed l[C]ow [G/B]
[Dm]Your s[C]ong is the [G/B]light that shines through my [Dm]wind[C]ow [G/B]

{soc}
  [C]And like the sun after all of the [Am]rain's gone 
 The morning without any [F]cloud comes with a [G]picture of Your [C]love[G] 
  [C]And when I think of the stars so [Am]high over me 
 The moon in the darkness lets [F]everyone see a [G]picture of Your [C]love[G] 
 {eoc}


Pre-Chorus:
[C]And after the rain has fallen [Am]and after the clouds all roll aw[F]ay
The s[G]weetest name re[C]mains on my [G]soul (repeat)

{soc}
 You're [C]faithful (You're always the same) 
 You're [Am]faithful (no, You never change) 
 You're [F]faithful[G], You're always [C]good, You're always [G]good 
 {eoc}


[C]Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of d[Am]eath
I have no doubt, You've already gone ah[F]ead
My fire by [Gsus]night, my cloud by [C]day[Gsus]
[C]Though ten thousand fall to my right and my [Am]left
Under the shadow of the Most High I find [F]rest
My fire by [Gsus]night, my cloud by [C]day[Gsus]


Ending:
And when you [C]hold me up, and when you hold me up
And when you [Am]hold me up, and when you hold me up
And when you [F]hold me up, and when you [Gsus]hold me up
Then I'm [C]safe, then I'm [Gsus]safe
