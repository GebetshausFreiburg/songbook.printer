{title: Unashamed Love (A190)}
{artist: Lamont Hiebert}

You're [G]calling me to lay aside the [C]worries of my day
To [Em7]quiet down my busy mind and [C]find a hiding place
[G/B]Worthy[C],   You are [Em7]worthy[C]


I [G]open up my heart and let my [C]spirit worship Yours
I [Em7]open up my mouth and let a [C]song of praise come forth
[G/B]Worthy[C],   You are [Em7]worthy[C]

{soc}
  [G]Of a childlike faith and [C]of my honest praise and [Em7]of my unashamed l[C]ove 
  [G]Of a holy life and [C]of my sacrifice and [Em7]of my unashamed l[C]ove 
 {eoc}


[G]You are worthy, [C]You are worthy, [Em7]You are worthy[C]
