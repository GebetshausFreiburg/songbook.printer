1. [Gm] In the beginning was the [Eb]Word, the One we have seen and we have [Bb]heard
The only Begotten of the [Fsus]Father
[Gm] "You are my one and only [Eb]Son" - "Not my will but Yours be [Bb]done"
All we can do is stand in [Fsus]wonder and [F/A]sing

{soc}
  [Gm]  Beauty, beauty, beautiful – [Eb]  glory, glory, glorious 
  [Bb]  you are –  [F]  you are 
 {eoc}


3. [Gm] Who has believed and who has [Eb]seen? The suffering servant is our [Bb]king
Though we despised You, You have [Fsus]loved us
[Gm]  The Branch of the Lord has been re[Eb]vealed, and by your wounds we have been [Bb]healed
All of the nations stand in [Fsus]wonder and [F/A]sing:

[Gm]Take me into your [Eb]throne-room
Let me see your [Bb]beauty, let me see your [F]face
