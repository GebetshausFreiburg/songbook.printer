1. Even though I [A]walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
Your [D2/F#]perfect love is casting out fear.
And even when I'm [A]caught in the middle of the storms of this life,
I [D2/F#]won't turn back, I know You are near.



Prechorus:
And I will fear no [F#m]e [E]-  v[A]il,  for my God is [F#m]wi -[E/G#]th [A]me.
And if my God is [F#m]wi -[E/G#]th [A]me
Whom then shall I [E]fear? Whom then shall I [D]fear?


{soc}
  [A]Oh no, You never let go, through the calm and through the storm 
  [F#m]Oh no, You never let go, in every high and every low 
  [E]Oh no, You never let go. [D2]Lord, You never let go of m[A]e. [Esus4] [D2] 
 {eoc}


2. And I can see a [A]light that is coming for the heart that holds on
A [D2/F#]glorious light beyond all compare.
And there will be an [A]end to these troubles, but until that day comes,
We'll [D2/F#]live to know You here on the earth.



Bridge:
Yes, I can see a [A]light that is coming for the heart that holds on
And there will be an [F#m]end to these troubles, but until that day comes
[E]Still I will praise You[D2], still I will praise you[A] [Esus4] [D2]
