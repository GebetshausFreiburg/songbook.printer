1.[C]  My hope is built on nothing less [F]  than Jesus' blood and [G]righteousness
[Am]  I dare not trust the [Am/G]sweetest frame [F]  but wholly [G]trust in Jesus' [C]name


{soc}
 Christ a[F]lone, [Am]Corner[G]stone
 [C/E]Weak made [F]strong in the [Am]Savior's [G]love
 [C]Through the [F]storm [Am]He is [G]Lord, Lord of [C]all
 {eoc}


2.[C]  When darkness seems to hide His face [F]  I rest on His un[G]changing grace
[Am]  In every high and [Am/G]stormy gale [F]  my anchor [G]holds within the [C]veil
[F]  My anchor [G]holds within the [C]veil


3. [C]  When he shall come with trumpet sound -[F]  oh may I then in [G]Him be found
[Am]  Dressed in His righteous[Am/G]ness alone [F]faultless [G]stand before the th[C]rone
