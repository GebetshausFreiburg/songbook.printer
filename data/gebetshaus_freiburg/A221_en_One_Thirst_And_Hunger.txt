1.[G]You say to [C]us: 'Seek My F[G]ace'

Anoint us [G]for the greater t[Em]hings[C]

  [G]We have gathered with [C]one thirst and hunger 
  [G]Here to drink of [C]glory and wonder 
  [Em]Here to cry out, '[C]Come and fill this [Em]place!'[C]

2.[G]Our single [C]wish, our sole des[G]ire
To gaze up[C]on Your beauty, [Em]God [C]

Till with our [C]eyes Your face we [Em]see [C]
