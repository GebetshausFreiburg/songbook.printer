1. [G]  Come let us t[C]urn to the [G/B]Lord, for he's c[Em]alled us [C]each his [G]own
[G]  Come let us l[C]ove for he [G]said, 'You have r[Em]avished [C]me my b[G]ride
I am y[Em]ours and y[C]ou are m[G]ine'

{soc}
 T[G]his is my prayer, it’s [D]my solemn vow 
 With [Em]all that I am with [C]all that I have 
 I will l[G/B]ove you, [D]  I will l[Em]ove you [C] 
 With [G]all of my heart, my [D]soul and my mind 
 I [Em]pour out an offering of w[C]orship and cry 
 I will l[G/B]ove you, [D]  I will [Em]love you [C] 
 {eoc}


2. [G]You call my n[C]ame, I’ll a[G/B]rise for your j[Em]ealous [C]for my h[G]eart.
[G]Forsaking it [C]all, for you s[G]aid,
'turn and [Em]leave your [C]fathers [G]home; come and [Em]cling to [C]me al[G]one'


Bridge: J[G]esus, [Bm7]I am [Em]yours, and for[C]ever
[G]I want [Bm7]nothing [Em]more than to [C]be with you


Oh to [G]be with you...[Bm7]  Oh to [Em]be with you... [C](2x)
