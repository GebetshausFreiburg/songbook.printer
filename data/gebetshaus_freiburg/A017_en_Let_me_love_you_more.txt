I'm in [Am]love with a Man [F]  I'm in [C]love with a [G]Stranger
I'm in [Am]love with my M[F]aker whom [C]I have never [G]seen
I'm in [Am]love with the Lamb [F]  I'm in [C]love with the [G]Lion
I'm in [Am]love with my S[F]avior whom [C]I have yet to kn[G]ow

{soc}
 O won't You [Am]let me love You m[F]ore, this is [C]all that I [G]desire 
 Won't You [Am]let me love You m[F]ore, this is [C]all that I req[G]uire 
 Won't You [Am]let me love You m[F]ore, this is my d[C]eepest heart's des[G]ire 
 Won't You [Am]let me love You m[F]ore, still m[C]ore and m[G]ore 
 {eoc}


[Am]  You could g[F]ive to me the g[C]ift of walking on w[G]ater
Maybe, [Am] maybe [F]I will raise the d[C]ead [G]
I have [Am]one life to live and [F]all I have to give to Y[C]ou is l[G]ove (2x)


[Am]  If I never [F]  walk on water [C]  if I never [G]  see the miracles
[Am]  If I never [F]  hear your voice so l[C]oud [G]
[Am]  Just knowing [F]  that You love me [C]  is enough to k[G]eep me here
[Am]  Just hearing [F]  those words [C]  is enough is en[G]ough to satisf[Am]y [F]
[C]  You do You do [G]  You satisf[Am]y [F] [C]I couldn't leave [G]even if I tried
[Am]  I must have You [F]  I must have You [C]  I must have You [G]
