1. [G]I'm giving You my [D]heart. All that is within.[C]
I [D]lay it all down[Em]. For the sake of [D/F#]You my [G]King.
I'm giving You my [D]dreams laying down my rights[C]
I'm giving up [D]my [Em]pride. For the promise of [D/F#]new [G]life.


{soc}
 And [Em]I Sur[G]ren[C]der[G] 
  [C2]All [Em]to [G]You, [Em7]all [G]to [D]You 
 {eoc}



2. I'm singing You this song. I'm waiting at the Cross.
All the world holds dear I count it all as loss.
For the sake of knowing You. For the glory of Your name,
To know the lasting joy. Even sharing in Your pain.
