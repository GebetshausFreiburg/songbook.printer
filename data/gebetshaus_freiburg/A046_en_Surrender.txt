1. [E]  I’m giving You my [Bsus]heart and all that is with[A2]in
I lay it [Bsus]all [C#m]down for the sake of [B/D#]You my [E]King
[E]  I’m giving You my [Bsus]dreams, I'm laying down my [A2]rights
I’m giving [Bsus]up my [C#m]pride for the promise [B/D#]of new [E]life


Chorus:
And [C#m]I [B/D#]        sur[E]render [A]all to [E]You, [C#m]all to [Bsus]You [A]
And [C#m]I [B/D#]        sur[E]render [A]all to [E]You, [C#m]all to [Bsus]You [A]


3. [E]  I’m singing You this [Bsus]song, I’m waiting at the [A2]cross
And all the [Bsus]world holds [C#m]dear, I count it [B/D#]all as [E]loss
[E]  For the sake of knowing [Bsus]You, the glory of Your [A2]name
To know the [Bsus]lasting [C#m]joy, even sharing [B/D#]in Your [E]pain
