{title: Welcome Home (A208)}
{artist: David Hüger}


[D]Did you hear?
[D/F#]There's a place called home
[G]It's not far,
Just around you here

Why you´re waiting, there is
Nothing to be ashamed of,
Hear the call
You may surrender slowly



{soc}
  [Bm]Welcome Home 
  [G]Home is where your heart is 
  [D]Home is where your dreams grow 
  [A]Home is where you love yourself 
 You can surrender your all
 Home is where your hopes rise
 Home is where you find life
 Home is where you know for sure
 I am safe, cared for
 {eoc}


[D]Please be [A]round me now,
[D/F#]Around me now, [G]surround me now (x2)
