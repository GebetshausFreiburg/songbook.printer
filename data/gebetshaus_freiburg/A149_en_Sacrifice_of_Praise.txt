1. [Bm]Let me not waste a [G]moment of this [D]life.
On [F#m]things that [Bm]are passing. On [G]things that are [D]fading a[F#m]way.
[Bm]Help me not let a [G]minute pass me [D]by.
Wit[F#m]hout thinking [Bm]of You. Wit[G]hout falling [D]deeper in [F#m]love.


Pre-Chorus: [G]You make my [D/F#]soul sing[Asus]
[G]You make my [D/F#]heart come a[Asus]live
[G]You are my [D/F#]portion in this [Asus]life [A]

{soc}
 I'll bring a [G]sacrif[D]ice of [A]praise 
 Into the [G]house of [D]Your sweet [A]name 
 I'll bring an [G]offer[D]ing that's [G/B]pleasing to Your [Asus]heart 
 I give You [G]praise that's [D]rightly [A]due 
 Laying down [G]all to [D]follow [A]You 
 I'll bring an [G]offer[D]ing that's [G/B]pleasing to Your [Asus]heart [A] 
 {eoc}



2. [Bm]How can I trade the [G]winnings of this [D]life
For the [F#m]excellence of k[Bm]nowledge, the [G]wonder that [D]I may gain Ch[F#m]rist.
[Bm]Help me to run the [G]race to win the p[D]rize
Of [F#m]that which You've [Bm]purchased
Of t[G]hat which You've [D]laid hold of [F#m]me

I'm wanting all of [G]You. I'm wanting all of [Em]You, Oh Lord.
