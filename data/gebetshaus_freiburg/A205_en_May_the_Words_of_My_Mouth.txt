1. May the [C]words of my mouth
And the medi[Am7]tations of my heart
Be [Fmaj7]pleasing to You, [Gsus]pleasing to [G]You
May the [C]words of my mouth
And the medi[Am]tations of my heart
Be [Fmaj7]pleasing to [Gsus]You, my [C]God

{soc}
 You're my [F]rock and [G]my red[C]eemer 
 You're the [F]reason [G]that I [C]sing 
 I des[F]ire to [G]be a [Am7]blessing [Dm7]in Your [Gsus]eyes[G] 
 Every [F]hour and [G]every [C]moment 
 Lord I [F]want to [G]be Your [C]servant 
 I des[F]ire to [G]be a [Am7]blessing [Dm7]in Your [Gsus]eyes[G] 
 In Your [F]eyes [C]
