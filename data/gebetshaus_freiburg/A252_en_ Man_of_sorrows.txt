{artist: Matt Crocker, Brooke Ligertwood}

1. [C]Man of sorrows, [F]lamb of [C]God, [F]by his [C]own be[G]trayed
The [Am]sin of man and [F]wrath of [Am]God has [F]been on [G]Jesus [C]laid


2. [C]Silent as he [F]stood ac[C]cused, [F]beaten, [C]mocked and [G]scorned
[Am]Bowing to the [F]Father's [Am]will he [F]took a [G]crown of [C]thorns


{soc}
 Oh that [Am]rugged [F]cross my [C]salva[G]tion 
 Where your [Am]love poured [F]out over [G]me 
 Now my [F]soul cries [C]out Halle[G]lu[Am]jah 
 Praise and [F]honour [G]unto [C]thee 
 {eoc}

3. [C]Sent of heaven, [F]God's own [C]Son, to [F]purchase [C]and re[G]deem
And [Am]reconcile the [F]very [Am]ones who [F]nailed him [G]to that [C]tree


4. [C]See the stone is [F]rolled a[C]way, be[F]hold the [C]empty [G]tomb
[Am]Hallelujah, [F]God be [Am]praised! He's [F]risen [G]from the [C]grave


{comment: Bridge}
Now my [Am]debt is [F]paid, it is [C]paid in [G]full
By the [Am]precious [F]blood that my [C]Jesus [G]spilled
Now the [Am]curse of [F]sin has no [C]hold on [G]me
Whom the [Am]son sets [F]free oh is [C]free in[G]deed
