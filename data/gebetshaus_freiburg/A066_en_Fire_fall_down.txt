1. [D]You bought my life with the blood that you shed on the [G]cross
When you died for the sins of men and you [A]let out a cry
Crucified - now alive in [D]me.


2. [D]These hands are yours, teach them to serve as you p[G]lease.
And I'll reach out desperate to see all the g[A]reatness of God.
May my soul rest assured in [D]you.

Pre-Chorus: [G]I'll never be the [A]same. [G]No, I'll never be the [A]same.

{soc}
 Cause I [D]know that you're a[G]live. 
 You came to [D]fix my broken [G]life. 
 And I'll [D]sing to glorif[G]y. 
 Your Holy [Bm]Name, Jesus [G]Christ. 
 {eoc}


3. [D]You changed it all. You broke down the wall
When I s[G]poke and confessed, in you I am blessed.
Now I [A]walk in the light, in victorious sight of [D]you.


Bridge 1: [D]Fire fall down,[G]fire fall [Bm]down on us we [G]pray.
As we [D]seek you, fire fall [G]down, your fire fall [Bm]down on us, we [G]pray.


Bridge 2: [D]Show me your [G]heart. Show me your [Bm]way. Show me your [G]glory.
