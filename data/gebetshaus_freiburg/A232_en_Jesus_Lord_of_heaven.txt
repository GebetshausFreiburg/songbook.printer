{artist: Phil Wickham}

1. [C]Jesus, Lord of heaven,[G] [Am]I do not deserve[F]
The [C]grace that you have given[G]or the [Am]promise of your word[F]


2. [C]Lord, I stand in wonder[G]of the [Am]sacrifice you made[F]
With [C]mercy beyond measure,[G]my [Am]debt you freely paid[F]


{soc}
 Your love is [C]deeper[G]than any ocean 
  [Am]Higher[F]than the heavens 
  [C]Reaches[G]beyond the stars in the [F]sky 
 {eoc}

Jesus, [Am]your love [G]has no [F]bounds
Jesus, [Am]your love [G]has no [F]bounds


{comment: Bridge 2}
Your love is [C]deep, your love is wide
Your love is [G]great, your love is high
Your love is [Am]all we ever need
Your love is [F]all we ever need [(last time)] [G]
