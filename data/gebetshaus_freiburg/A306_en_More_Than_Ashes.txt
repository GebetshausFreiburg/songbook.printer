{title: More Than Ashes (A306)}
{artist: Tim Reimherr}

1. I’m [G]more than what these ashes [Bm/F#]say
They will fade [C]away when He [D]comes for [G]me
By [G]grace through faith in Christ I’m [Bm/F#]saved
I am not the [C]same when He [D]looks at [G]me


{soc}
 I am the [C]rose, the [D]joy for which You [G]died 
 And this I [C]know, I [D]move You with de[G]light 
 And when my [C]heart cond[D]emns on every [Em]side 
 I take refuge in the [C]truth]rose to [G]You 
 {eoc}


2. My [G]life is more than meets the [Bm/F#]eye
I’m hidden now in [C]Christ and I’m [D]one with [G]Him
My [G]love is real before His [Bm/F#]eyes
He’s ravished by the [C]sight of one [D]glance from [G]me


I am the [G]rose, I am the [D]lily
I am [Em]Yours, I’m Your [C]beauty

[G]There’s gonna be a [D]wedding,
It’s the reason that I’m [Em]living, to marry the [C]Lamb
