{title: Your love reaches me (A370)}
{artist: Darren Clarke}

1. [A7]You are the [G2/B]fountain of my [G]life [D] [A7sus4]
[A7]and in Your [G2/B]light I find my [G]reason [D] [A7sus4]
[A7]`cause Your love [G2/B]reaches to the [G]stars, even the [D]great [A7sus4]deep
[A7]And Your love [G2/B]reaches to this [G]heart and it [D]makes me [A7sus4]sing

{soc}
  [D]Your love reaches me, it´s [G]what I need, it´s [Em7]what I need 
  [D]Your love reaches me, it´s [G]what I need, it´s [Em7]what I need 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
Oh [G]Lord, how [D]priceless is [Bm]Your unending [G]love
Both [G]high and [D]low find [Bm]refuge in Your [G]shadow


End:
[Dsus/A]Your love [D]reaches me [G2/B]like the rivers [G]run to the sea
[G2]It´s what I [D]need, Lord, [G2/B]You´re what I [G]need, Lord
