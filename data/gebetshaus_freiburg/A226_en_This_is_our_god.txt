[E] [G#m] [C#m] [A]

1.[E]Your grace is en[E/G#]ough, more than I n[C#m]eed
At your [A]word I will bel[E]ieve
I wait for you[E/G#], draw near aga[C#m]in, let your Sp[A]irit make me n[B]ew

{soc}
 And I will [E/G#]fall at your [A]feet, I will [F#m7]fall at your [B/D#]feet 
 And I will [E/G#]worship you h[A]ere 
 {eoc}


2.[E]Your presence in me[E/G#], Jesus light the [C#m]way
By the [A]power of your w[E]ord
I am rest[E/G#]ored, I am red[C#m]eemed, by your Sp[A]irit I am fr[B]ee


Bridge:
Freely you [E]gave it all for us, surrendered your [B]life upon that cross
Great is the [F#m]love poured out for [C#m]all, this [A]is our [E]God
Lifted on [E]high from death to life, forever our [B]God is glorified
Servant and [F#m]king, rescued the [C#m]world, this [A]is our [E]God
