 When You think of [B]me, when You [F#]hear my [G#m]name 
 When You see my [E]face, let it be with [B/D#]mer[F#]cy 
 When thoughts of [B]me come to Your [F#]memor[G#m]y 
 Or my story [E]told, let it be [B/D#]mer[F#]cy 
 {eoc}


1. Don't re[G#m]member [E]me acc[B/D#]ording to my [F#]sin
But re[G#m]member [E]me with com[B/D#]pas-[F#]sion
When my [C#m]voice is [E]heard a[B/D#]round Your [F#]throne
Let it [C#m]strike Your [E]heart with [B/D#]love al[F#]one


2. When I [G#m]stand face to [E]face and look You [B/D#]in the [F#]eyes
See my [G#m]heart, see my [E]soul, how I [B/D#]fought the [F#]fight
Blot [C#m]out all my [E]sin when You [B/D#]look at [F#]me
Let my [C#m]life [E]be a treasured [B/D#]memor[F#]y
