{title: Take Me In (A138)}
{artist: Dave Browning}

Take me [Em]past the outer courts in[Cmaj7]to the holy place,
[D]Past the brazen altar; Lord, I [Em]want to see Your [D]face.
Pass me [Em]by the crowds of people,
And the [Cmaj7]priests who sing their praise;
I [D]hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,
But it's [Am7]only found one [C/D]place.


{soc}
 So take me [Em]into the Holy of [D/E]Holies, 
 Take me [Am7]in by the [Am7/D]blood of the [Em]Lamb;[Cmaj7] 
 So [C/D]take me [Em]into the Holy of [D/E]Holies, 
 Take the [Am7]coal, [Am7/D]cleanse my [A/B]lips, [B+7]here I [Em]am.
