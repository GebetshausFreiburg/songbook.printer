1. [C]There He sits, u[Am7]pon a throne, sus[F]tainer of all [Gsus]things
The [C]elders bow, the [Am7]angels sing this [F]song, forever[Gsus]more

Pre-Chorus: 
[Dm7]How can I [F]comprehend the [Am]beauty that [G]has no end
He's [Dm7]beckoned us to [F]come and [Am]see [Gsus]
[Dm7]Every nation [F]testifies, Your [Am]majesty they [G]can't deny
Your [Dm7]Son has made a [F]way for them to [Am]come [Gsus]

{soc}
 There is only [C]One, there is only [Am7]One 
 There is only [F]One found wor[G]thy (repeat)
 {eoc}

{soc}
 There is only [C]One (Jesus Christ)
 There is only [Am7]One (Jesus Christ)
 There is only [F]One (The Lamb upon the throne)
 Found wor[G]thy (Forever) (repeat)
 {eoc}

Bridge:
[F]What do the elders [C]see, that [G]makes them all fall [Am]down
[F]What do the angels [C]see that makes them cry, "[G]holy"
We have to [F]know[C],  we have to [G]know[Am]
We have to [F]know[C] what makes them cry "[G]holy"

[F]  So open our [C]eyes to see the [G]wonder of Your [Am]majesty
[F]  To join the [C]song that all of [G]heaven sings
