 To [F#m7]walk in the cool of the [E/G#]day with You 
 To [C#m]gaze on the beauty of [B/D#]all You do 
 To [F#m7]meditate on Your [E/G#]glorious splendor 
 I was m[A]ade for You[B]

To be [C#m]called a lover of [B]God
To speak face to [D]face, to know all Your [A]thoughts
To a[G#m]bide in Your [C#m]love, in Your love in [B]me
To keep Your comm[D]ands, that I may be [A]filled [E/G#]with [B]joy
