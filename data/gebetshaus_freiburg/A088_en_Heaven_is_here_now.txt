1. [G]In Heaven there'll be perfect peace. There'll be [Em]joy in the streets and
every mouth will be [D]singing your praise. There'll be no sorrow at [Am]all.


2. [G]We will be free from every chain and our [Em]bodies will be whole again.
And Your [D]church will be one spotless beautiful [Am]bride.


{comment: prechorus}
For your [C]Glory. We'll see Your [Am]Glory.


{soc}
 Heaven is [G]here now. Your Spirit is [Am]here now 
 Lord we be[C]lieve it, We've started to see it. 
 Your Kingdom [G]come. 
 Lord come and [G]reign here. Come have Your [Am]way here 
 Establish your [C]rule, Come take the throne, 
 Your Kingdom [G]come. 
 {eoc}

[G]Take all I am Lord and use me for Your Glory
[Em]Take all I am Lord use me for Your Glory
[Am]I'm not my own. [C]I belong[G]to the king.
