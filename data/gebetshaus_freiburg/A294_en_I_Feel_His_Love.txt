{artist: Laura Hackett Park}

1. My [Bb]faith it lifts the [F/A]weight of pain from [Gm]lonely and [Fsus]mistaken [F]days
Of [Eb]hiding behind [Bb/D]deep, dark lies of [Eb]worthlessness and selfish [Fsus]pride[F]
My [Bb]faith is my [F/A]belief in truth that [Gm]God above loves [Fsus]me and [F]you
And [Eb]gave us freedom, [Bb/D]gave us life to [Eb]walk in love through [Fsus]Jesus [F]Christ

Pre-Chorus:
[Eb]  I am confident[F] that neither life nor death
[Bb/D] Can keep me from the love of Christ,[Gm] can keep me from the [F]love of Christ
[Eb]  Though I cannot see,[F] still my heart believes
[Bb/D]And I am [Gm]filled with [F]joy inexpressible

{soc}
 [Bb] I feel His love welling up on the [F]inside of me 
 [Bb] All those years bound in shame - He is [F]setting me free 
 [Gm] His love goes deeper than the [Eb]pain that I f[F]eel  
 His love is stronger than dep[Eb]ression and [Bb]fear 
 {eoc}

(It's [F]grea[Bb]ter, it's [F]stron[Gm]ger)   [F]

2. Now [Bb]love is a choice, I [F/A]know it's true, he [Gm]never forced my [Fsus]heart to [F]move
But [Eb]therein lies the [Bb/D]mystery that [Eb]he reached first in choosing [Fsus]me[F]
And he [Bb]spoke my name, the [F/A]sweetest sound, and [Gm]to this day I [Fsus]still re[F]sound
Now [Eb]death has lost its [Bb/D]hold on me and [Eb]life springs up a[Fsus]bundant[F]ly
