{title: Holding On (A193)}
{artist: Kevin Prosch}

1. [C]I've been tested and tried when You counted on me, but I've [F]failed You, oh I've [G]failed You.
And the [C]prayers I prayed, promises I made, I could not keep [F]them though I've [G]tried.
I should [C]know by know by now that I can run to You and You'll embrace [F]me, not for[G]sake me.
That it's [C]not my goodness, that caused You to love me, but in my [G]failures You loved me still.


2. [C]How many ways could I tell You, that I [F]love You, oh I [G]love You.
[C]How many ways can I tell You, that I [F]need You, oh I need [G]You.
You [C]always provide and You care for me. I'm so [F]grateful - so [G]thankful.
Every[C]thing is mine because I am Yours. What [G]else do I need, when there is no more.



Pre-Chorus:
[A]And the weakness of God[F#m]is stronger than the strength [D]of man
And the [E]shame is leaving me now
[A]This is what I [F#m]want, to be drawn near[D]to be set [E]free.
[F]There is now no condemnation for those [G]who are in You, Lord.
[F]I still want to walk with You, to ta[G]lk with You, to hear [A]Your voice.

{soc}
  [D]I'm holding on to the hem of Your garment, I [G]won't let go 'till the [A]blessing comes. 
  [D]I'm bowing low at the foot of the cross. For You [G]my Lord, I would [A]give it all. 
  [D]I'm holding on to the hem of Your garment, I [G]won't let go 'till the [A]healing comes. 
  [D]I'm bowing low at the foot of the cross. To [G]be transformed this is [A]what I want. 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
[A]You could offer me thi[F#m]ngs, silver lined dreams[D].
But to be trans[E]formed into the image of God[A]
[A]This is what I [F#m]want, to be drawn near[D], to be set free[E].
[F]And in all of my mistakes I know[G]You love me still.
[F]I want to know what pleases You, I'm bro[G]ken Lord, I'm broken [A]Lord.
