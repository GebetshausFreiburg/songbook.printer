just to [Em]find I'm [D/F#]at Your [G]feet


[Em]I'll [D/F#]leave my [G]father's house and
[Em]I'll [D/F#]leave my [G]mother
[Em]I'll [D/F#]leave all [G]I have known and
[Em]I'll [D/F#]have no [G]other.

  [Em]I [D/F#]am in l[G]ove with You, there is no cost. 
  [Em]I [D/F#]am in l[G]ove with You, there is no loss. 
  [Em]I [D/F#]am in l[G]ove with You, I want to take Your name. 
  [Em]I [D/F#]am in l[G]ove with You, I want to clin[Em]g to You,[D/F#]Jes[G]us. 
 Just let me clin[Em]g to You,[D/F#]Jes[G]us.
