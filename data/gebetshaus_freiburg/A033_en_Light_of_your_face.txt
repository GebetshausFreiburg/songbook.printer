Oh Lord bl[F]ess me and k[C]eep me,
C[G]ause your face to s[Am]hine on me.
Lord be gr[F]acious, lift the light of your c[C]ountenance.
G[G]ive me peace.

{soc}
 For [Dm]I live [Am]only 
 to s[G]ee your face, so shine on me. (2x) 
 {eoc}


Let the [Dm]light of your face
shine d[Am]own on my heart and
[Gsus4]let m[G]e [Gsus4]feel [G]it.
