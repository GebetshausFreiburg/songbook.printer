{title: Desert Song (A161)}
{artist: Brooke Ligertwood}


1. [Bm]This is my prayer [A]in the [G]desert
When [Bm]all that's within [A]me feels d[G]ry
[Bm]This is my prayer [A]in my [G]hunger and need
My [Bm]God is the God w[A]ho prov[G]ides


2. This is my prayer in the fire, in weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flame


{soc}
 I will bring p[D]raise, I will bring p[A]raise 
 No weapon [G]formed against me shall rem[D]ain 
 I will re[A]joice, I will dec[Bm]lare 
 God is my [G]victory and [A]He is [Bm]here 
 {eoc}



3. This is my prayer in the battle, when triumph is still on its way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ, so firm on His promise I'll stand


4. This is my prayer in the harvest, when favour and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again, the seed I've received I will sow


Bridge: 
[D]All of my life, in every season
[Bm]You are still God, I have a reason to [A]sing.
[G]I have a reason to w[D]orship.
