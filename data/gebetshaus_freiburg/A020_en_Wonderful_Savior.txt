1. [A]  I bring a sacrifice of [Amaj7]praise
[F#m]  With all my heart my hands to You I raise
And I [D]  say what a w[E]onderful Savior You [F#m]are   [C#m]
[A]  A song of love I [Amaj7]bring,
[F#m]  with simple words and a simple melody
and I [D]  say what a w[E]onderful Savior You [F#m]are  [C#m]


Pre-Chorus
All I [F#m]am is because of You, [E]  is because of your [Bm]blood
All I [F#m]am is because of You, [E]  is because of Your l[D]ove  [E]

{soc}
 Wonderful [A]Savi[C#m]or, beautiful G[D]od 
 Intimate [A]Mak[C#m]er, I give you my l[D]ove 
 {eoc}


2. [A]  In sacrifice You came f[Amaj7]or me
[F#m]  became a man and You died upon a tree
And I [D]  say what a w[E]onderful Savior You [F#m]are  [C#m]
[A]  Risen Lord, Most High [Amaj7]King
[F#m]Coming with the clouds, and every eye will see
And I [D]  say what a w[E]onderful Savior You [F#m]are  [C#m]
