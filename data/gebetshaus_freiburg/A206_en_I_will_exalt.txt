{title: I will exalt (A206)}
{artist: Amanda Falk}

Your [D]presence is all I need
It's [Asus/C#]all I want, all I seek
With[G]out it, with[Bm]out it there's no [A]meaning
Your [D]presence is the air I breathe
The [Asus/C#]song I sing and the love I need
With[G]out it, with[Bm]out it I'm not [A]living

{soc}
 I will ex[G]alt You, [A]Lord, I will ex[Bm]alt [A/C#]You, [D]Lord 
 There is [G]no one [Bm]like You, [A]God 
 I will ex[G]alt You, [A]Lord, I will ex[Bm]alt [A/C#]You, [D]Lord 
 No other [G]name be [Bm]lifted [A]high 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
There will be [Dsus4]no - [D]one [A]like You
And [Em]no one bes[G]ide You
You al[D]one are [A]worthy of all [G]praise
