1.[D]  Your love is devoted[Em]  like a ring of solid [G]gold
Like a vow that is tested,[F#m]  like a c[A]ovenant of [D]old
Your love is enduring [Em]  through the winter [G]rain
And beyond the horizo[F#m]n   with [A]mercy for tod[G]ay

{comment: Prechorus 1:}
[G]Faithful You have [D]been, and faithful You will [A]be
You pledge yourself to [Em]me and it`s why I sing

{soc}
 Your [G]praise will ever be on my [D]lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your [Bm]praise will ever be on my [A]lips, ever be on my lips 
 {eoc}


2. [D]  You father the orphan,[Em]  Your kindness makes us w[G]hole
You shoulder our weakness [F#m]  and Your st[A]rength becomes our [D]own
You`re making me like you,[Em]  clothing me in w[G]hite
Bringing beauty from ashes[F#m]   for Y[A]ou will have Your b[G]ride

{comment: Prechorus 2:}
[G] Free of all her [D]guilt, rid of all her [A]shame 
And known by her true [Em]name, and it's why I sing


{comment: Bridge:}
[D]  You will be praised,[Em]  You will be praised
[Bm]  With angels and saints we sing [G]worthy are You Lord
