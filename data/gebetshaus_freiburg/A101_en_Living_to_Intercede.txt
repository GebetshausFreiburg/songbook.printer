He [Am7]prays that my [Gsus4]faith would not [Fmaj7]fail [Dm7](2x)

He's always [Dm7]living to inter[Am7]cede
Yeah yeah yeah, [Gsus4]yeah yeah yeah[Fmaj7]
He's always [Dm7]living to inter[Am7]cede
Yeah yeah yeah, [Gsus4]yeah yeah yeah[Fmaj7]
He's always [Dm7]living to inter[Am7]cede[Gsus4] [Fmaj7] [Dm7]


There is a [Am7]power that is greater, a [Gsus4]force that is stronger
A [Fmaj7]power that is greater than my [Dm7]sin nature

It is [Em7]God's desire for [Am7]me[Gsus4] [Fmaj7] [Dm7]

I know if [C]God is [C/B]for me, [Bb]who could be [Am]against me?
I know if [C]God is [C/B]for me, [Bb]who could be [Am]against me?

I will [Esus4]lean [E]into His [Am7]prayer[Gsus4] [Fmaj7] [Dm7]

[Dm]Satan has asked to [Dm6]sift you as [Dm]wheat,
But I [Dm]pray that your faith would not fail
[Dm]Father, I desire, Father, I desire mercy (2x)

[Am7]Father, I [Gsus4]desire, [Fmaj7]Father, I de[Dm7]sire mercy (2x)
