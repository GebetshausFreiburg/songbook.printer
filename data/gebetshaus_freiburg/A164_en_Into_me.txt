{artist: Tim Reimherr}

1. [E]Hollow, I was lost inside; [B/D#]desperate, couldn’t see the light
[C#m7]Naked, and [B]feeling all the [A]cold[F#m7]
[E]Empty, like a joyless day; en[B/D#]tangled, I was someone’s slave
[C#m7]Stranded and [B]feeling all a[A]lone[F#m7]

{soc}
 Till You [A]came and [E]stepped right into [B]me:II [F#m7] 
 {eoc}


2. [E]Crying, ‘cause You’re just so good; [B/D#]laughing, as a child should
[C#m7]Dancing, ‘cause I’ll [B]never be a[A]lone[F#m7]
[E]Waiting, for our wedding day; [B/D#]longing, just to see Your face
[C#m7]Aching, for the [B]best is yet to [A]come[F#m7]

{soc}
 Won’t You [A]come and [E]step right into [B]me:II [F#m7] 
 {eoc}


3. Praying, Your kingdom come; living, Your will be done
Giving, I’m laying down my life
Watching, for the day will come; choosing, living in Your love
Abiding, for I’m nothing without You

{soc}
 Won’t You [A]come and [E]live Your life in [B]me:II [F#m7] 
 {eoc}


Bridge:
[C#m]All I’m searching [A]for is found in [E]You, in You
[C#m]All I’m longing [A]for is found in [E]You.
[C#m]All I’m reaching [A]for is found in [E]You, in You
[C#m]All I’m living [A]for is found in [E]You
Won’t You [A]come and [E]live Your life in [B]me:II
