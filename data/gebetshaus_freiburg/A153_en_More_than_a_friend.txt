{artist: Jeremy Riddle}

1. In the [C2]quiet of my [G]soul
In the [C2]stillness I [G]hear your [D/F#]voice [C2]call
[Am7]And I am overw[G/B]helmed, [Am7]and I am lost for [G/B]words
To desc[D]ribe [G]you

{soc}
  [G]Jesus, you're [D/F#]more than a [Em]friend 
 Jesus you're more than my [C2]heart could [Dsus4]ev - [D]er exp[G]ress 
 Your [G]love and your [D/F#]grace never [Em]fail me 
 Your merciful touch always [C2]heals me 
 You bring [Dsus]joy [D]to my [C2]soul [G] 
 {eoc}



2. My heart longs to [C2]worship you, my[G]King
And I long to [C2]bring you a [G]pleasing [D/F#]offer[C2]ing
[Am7]And I am overw[G/B]helmed, [Am7]and I am lost for [G/B]words
To desc[D]ribe [G]you
