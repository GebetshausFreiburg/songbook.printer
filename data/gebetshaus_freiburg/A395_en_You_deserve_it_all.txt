1.[G]  Found in Your name the power to [D]save
With only a [Bm]whisper [A]mountains [G]shake
Jesus, our [D]hope and [A]strength
[G]  You made a way, unlocked these [D]chains
Here in Your [Bm]presence [A]strongholds [G]break
Freed by the [D]love You [A]gave


{soc}
 We give You the [D]highest [A]praise, You deserve it [Em]all, You deserve it [G]all 
 {eoc}


2.[G]  There on a tree, merciful [D]King
Broken and [Bm]shamed for [A]all to [G]see
The Father laid [D]down His [A]Son
[G]  From darkness to [D]light, death lost to [A]life
Heaven and [Bm]earth will [A]join and [G]sing
Jesus has [D]over[A]come


{comment: Bridge:}
With [Bm]every breath thatâ€™s in my [A]lungs
My [D]heart cries out to You be[A]longs the [G]glory, the [A]glory
Through [Bm]every loss or victo[A]ry
My [D]soul will rise to only [A]bring You [G]glory, you [A]glory
