1.[Dm]Welcome into the [A]courts of the King.
I've been[Fmaj7]ushered into Your [G2]presence.
[Dm]Lord, I stand on Your [A]merciful ground.
Yet with[Fmaj7]every step tread with [G2]reverence. [Bbmaj7]

{soc}
 And I'll [F]fall face[Bb]down. As Your [Dm]glory [C]shines a[Bb]round. 
 And I'll [F]fall face[Bb]down. As Your [Dm]glory [C]shines a[Bb]round. 
 {eoc}


2. [Dm]Who is there in the [A]heavens like You?
And [Fmaj7]upon the earth, who's Your [G2]equal?
You are[Dm]far above, You're the [A]highest of heights.
We are[Fmaj7]bowing down to ex[G2]alt You. [Bbmaj7]

{comment: Outro}
[Bb]Lord, let your glory shine ar[C]ound.
Let your glory shine ar[Bb]ound.
King of glory here be [C]found, King of glory.
