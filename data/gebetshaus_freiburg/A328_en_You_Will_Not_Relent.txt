For you [Bm]came and you [D]died
To re[G]deem your [D]bride

 1. [Bm]It's all about a wedding to [D]come 
 It's all about a God who's a [G]lov[D]er

{comment: Bridge:}
 I want to know the [Bm]yearnings [A/C#]of your [D]heart 
 I want to feel you [Bm]burn [A/C#]for [D]me 
 I want to know the [Bm]yearnings [A/C#]of your [D]heart 
 And feel your [G]jealous jealou[A]sy and feel you [G]burn for [A]me
