{soc}
  [G]Just knowing that You're here with me [C]now 
 It changes everything[G](x2) 
 {eoc}


[Bm]Cause I thought that I had to [C]make it on my own
[Bm]But you stopped that and cl[C]aimed me as Your own
[Bm]I thought that I had to [C]make it on my own
[Bm]You stopped that and [C]called me Yours, You called me Yours

Bridge:
[D]Dont't give up on me now cause I'm [C]scared
And I need you strong when I'm [G]weak
Hold on and be[Am]lieve in [C]me
When my [D]heart just can't figure out what it [C]wants
Please give me a reason to t[G]rust you'll still
Fight for [Am]me[C]
