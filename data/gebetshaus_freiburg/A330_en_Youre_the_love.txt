1. You’re the [C]sun[Cmaj9]shine on my [Fmaj7]face
When it’s [C]pouring with [Cmaj9]doubt, fear and [Fmaj7]rain
You break [C]through, You break [Cmaj9]through and there is [Fmaj7]light
You’re the [C]truth in my life, [Cmaj9]You’re the truth in my [Fmaj7]life

{soc}
 You’re the [Fmaj7]love, [Gsus4]    You’re the [Am]love [G/B] 
 You’re the [Fmaj7]love, [Gsus4]    You’re the [Am]love [G/B]

2. You’re the [C]sun[Cmaj9]shine in this [Fmaj7]place
When it’s [C]cold and it’s [Cmaj9]dark and I need [Fmaj7]grace
You break [C]through, You break [C]through and there is [Fmaj7]hope
You draw [C]near to me Lord, [Cmaj9]You draw near to me [Fmaj7]Lord



{soc}
 You’re the [C]love, [Cmaj9]    You’re the [Fmaj7]love 
 You’re the [C]love, [Cmaj9]    You’re the [Fmaj7]love 
 {eoc}
