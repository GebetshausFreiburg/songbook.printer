1. [C]Cast all your cares on Me [G/B]
For I care for [Am]you, I care for [F2]you [G]


{soc}
 [C]  ‘Cause all your fountains are in [G/B]Me, 
 and I have everything you [Am]need 
 Just [F2]keep coming [G]back to [C]Me
 [C]  Those who call upon My [G/B]name 
 They will not be put to [Am]shame
 Just [F2]keep coming [G]back to [C]Me
 {eoc}


2. So [C]come to me if you’re weary [G/B]
And I’ll give you [Am]rest, I’ll give you [F2]rest [G]
[C]My yoke is so easy [G/B]  
And my burden is [Am]less, my burden is [F2]less [G]
