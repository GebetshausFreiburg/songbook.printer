{title: I can only imagine (A131)}
{artist: Bart Millard}

1. I can only im[D]agine what it will be like when I [G]walk by Your side.
I can only [D]imagine what my eyes will see when Your [G]face is before me.
I can only im[D]agine, I can only i[G]magine.


{soc}
 Sur[Gsus2]rounded by Your glory, what [Asus4]will my heart feel? 
 Will I [D]dance for You, Jesus, or in awe of You be still? 
 Will I [Gsus2]stand in Your presence or to my [Asus4]knees will I fall? 
 Will I [D]sing Hallelujah? Will I be [Asus4]able to speak at all? 
 I can only [Gsus2]imagine,[Asus4]I can only im[D]agine. 
 {eoc}



2. [E]I can only imagine when that [Asus2]day comes,
When I [Asus2]find myself standing [H]in the sun,
I can only [E]imagine when all [Esus4]I will do
Is for[Asus2]ever, forever [H]worship You.
I can only [E]imagine. I can only [Asus2]imagine[H].


Ending: I can only [Asus2]imagine[H], I can only [E]imagine.
I can only [Asus2]imagine[H], I can only [C#m(sus2)]imagine. (2x)
