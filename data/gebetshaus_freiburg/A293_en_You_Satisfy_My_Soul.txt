  You satis[Db2]fy my [Ebsus4]soul, you [Ab/C]satisfy my [Fm]soul 
  You satis[Db2]fy my [Ebsus4]soul with your [Ab]love 
 {eoc}


You make my [Db]heart [Ebsus4]sing, you lift me on [Ab/C]eagles` [Fm]wings
Just when I [Db]thought that my [Ebsus4]heart it would [Ab]faint
You take the [Db]darkest [Ebsus4]night and turn it to [Ab/C]shining [Fm]light
Just when I [Db]thought that the [Ebsus4]night had [Ab]won

[Fm]Halle - [Eb/G]lu - [Ab]ja,  you make [Db]all things beautiful
[Fm]Halle - [Eb/G]lu - [Ab]ja,  trials and [Db]testing prove there's gold
[Fm]Halle - [Eb/G]lu - [Ab]ja,  you turn [Db]mourning into [Eb]joy
