{title: Hosanna (S178)}
{artist: Brooke Ligertwood}

1. [E]I see the King of glory
[C#m]Coming on the clouds with fire.
The whole earth [F#m7]shakes,
the whole earth [B]shakes. [C#m]


2. [E]I see His love and mercy
[C#m]Washing over all our sin.
The people [F#m7]sing,
the people [B]sing.


{soc}
 Ho[E/G#]sanna, [A]ho[B]san[C#m]na, 
 Ho[A]sanna in the [C#m]highest. [B] 
 Ho[E/G#]sanna, [A]ho[B]san[C#m]na, 
 Ho[A]sanna in the [B]high[C#m]est. 
 {eoc}



3. [E]I see a generation
[C#m]Rising up to take their place.
With selfless [F#m7]faith,
with selfless [B]faith.


4. [E]I see a near revival
[C#m]Stirring as we pray and seek.
We're on our [F#m7]knees,
we're on our [B]knees.


{comment: Bridge}
[A]Heal my heart and make it [B]clean.
[E]Open up my eyes to the [C#m]things unseen.
[A]Show me how to love like [B]You have loved [C#m]me.
[A]Break my heart for what breaks [B]Yours.
[E]Everything I am for Your [C#m]Kingdom's cause.
[A]As I walk from earth in[B]to eterni[A]ty.
