1. [D]Ev’ryone needs com[A]passion,
Love that's never [F#m]failing.
Let [E]mercy fall on me.
[D]Ev’ryone needs forgive[A]ness,
The kindness of a [F#m]Saviour.
The [E]hope of nations. [D] [E] [D] [E]


{soc}
  [A]Saviour, He can move the [E]mountains. 
 My God is [D]mighty to [A]save. 
 He is [F#m]mighty to [E]save. 
  [A]Forever Author of [E]salvation. 
 He rose and [D]conquered the [A]grave. 
 Jesus [F#m]conquered the [E]grave. 
 {eoc}



2. [D]So take me as You [A]find me,
All my fears and [F#m]failures.
[E]Fill my life again.
[D]I give my life to [A]follow,
Ev’rything I be[F#m]lieve in.
Now [E]I surrender. [D] [E] [D] [E]


{comment: Bridge}
[D]Shine your light [A]and let the whole [E]world see.
We're [F#m]singing [D]for the glo[A]ry of the ris[E]en King.
[F#m]Jesus.
[D]Shine your light [A]and let the whole [E]world see.
We're [F#m]singing [D]for the glo[A]ry of the ris[E]en King.
