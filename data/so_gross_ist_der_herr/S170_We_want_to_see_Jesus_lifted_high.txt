{title: We want to see Jesus lifted high (S170)}
{artist: Doug Horley}

[G]We want to see Je[D]sus lifted hi[Em]gh,
A banner that fli[C]es across this la[G]nd,
That all men might s[D]ee the truth and k[Em]now:
He is the w[C]ay to heaven.

  [G]We want to see, [D]we want to see, 
  [Em]We want to see Je[C]sus lifted hi[G]gh. 
  [G]We want to see, [D]we want to see, 
  [Em]We want to see Je[C]sus lifted hi[G]gh.

Step by st[D]ep we're moving for[Em]ward,
Little by lit[D]tle taking gr[Em]ound,
Evâ€™ry pr[D]ayer a powerful we[Em]apon,
Strongholds co[C]me tumbling do[D]wn,
And down and down and down.


{soc}
  [G]We're gonna see, [D]we're gonna see, 
  [Em]We're gonna see Je[C]sus lifted hi[G]gh. 
  [G]We're gonna see, [D]we're gonna see, 
  [Em]We're gonna see Je[C]sus lifted hi[G]gh.
