{artist: Jenn Johnson, Steffany Frizzel Gretzinger, Ian McIntosh, Gabriel Wilson, Dan MacKenzie, Hunter Thompson}

1. The [Cm]wind and waves surround me and I’m [Ab]tossed, feel like I’m drowning
[Bb]I am tired, I am weak, I need You here w[Fm]ith me 
‘Cause [Cm]I can feel the rising tide, but [Ab]I don’t have the strength to fight 
I feel [Bb]clouded and confused, I need You here w[Fm]ith me


{comment: Pre-Chorus 1/2:}
In the [Ab]chaos of the storm, [Fm]I have drifted far, far a[Eb]way
But [Ab]I call out Your name 'cause [Fm]You are just a breath, a breath a[Eb]way[Bb]


{soc}
 [Eb]  Then through the shadows Your light appears 
 [Cm7]I’ve known You’re with me, but now it is clear 
 I can [Ab]feel You, Jesus, all a[Bbsus]round 
 Like [Eb]  sun on my skin, warm to the touch 
 [Cm7] Here You surround me, and I am held by love 
 I can [Ab]feel You, Jesus, all a[Bbsus]round 
 {eoc}


2. Now [Cm]hope is rushing through my veins with [Ab]everything You’ve rearranged
And [Bb]I am peaceful, I am brave, when You’re here with [Fm]me
all my [Cm]questions find their answers here; hen You [Ab]come You change the atmosphere
I am [Bb]focused, I am clear, when You’re here with [Fm]me


{comment: Pre-Chorus 3:} 
There is [Ab]nothing in this world that will [Fm]satisfy my soul like You [Eb]do
There is [Ab]nothing in this world that will [Fm]satisfy my soul like You [Eb]do[Bb]


{comment: End-Chorus-Tag:}
[Eb]  Though the storm it rages, I won’t be moved
[Cm7] I won't be shaken, I am anchored in You, 
I can [Ab]feel You, Jesus all a[Bb]round
