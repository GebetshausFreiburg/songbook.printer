<div class="chorus"><div class="chorus-text">
  <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>Where you go I go 
 What you say I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m/A</span></span>say 
 What you pray I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>pray 
 What you pray I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>pray 
 </div></div>



<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>Jesus only did <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m/A</span></span>what he saw you do
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>He would only say what he heard you speak
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>He would only move <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m/A</span></span>when he felt you lead
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>Following your heart, following your Spirit


Pre-Chorus
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>How could I expect to walk with<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A2</span></span>out you
When <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>every move that Jesus made was in surrender
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>I will not begin to live with<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A2</span></span>out you
For <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>you alone are worthy and <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#sus</span></span>you are always <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#</span></span>good


Bridge
Though the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>world sees and soon forgets
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A2</span></span>We will not forget who you are and what you've <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Em</span></span>done for us
