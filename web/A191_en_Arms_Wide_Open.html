'What does love look like?' is the question I've been pondering. 'What does love look like?'</div><div class="textonly">
'What does love look like?' is the question I've been asking of You</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
I once believed that love was romance, just a chance</div><div class="textonly">
I even thought that love was for the lucky and the beautiful</div><div class="textonly">
I once believed that love was a momentary bliss but love is more than this</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
All You ever wanted was my attention, all You ever wanted was love from me</div><div class="textonly">
All You ever wanted was my affections, to sit here at Your feet</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
Then I sat down, a little frustrated and confused</div><div class="textonly">
If all of life comes down to love then love has to be more than sentiment</div><div class="textonly">
More than selfishness and selfish gain</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
And then I saw Him there hanging on a tree, looking at me</div><div class="textonly">
I saw Him there hanging on a tree, looking at me</div><div class="textonly">
He was looking at me, looking at Him, staring through me</div><div class="textonly">
I could not escape those beautiful eyes and I began to weep and weep</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
He had arms wide open, a heart exposed</div><div class="textonly">
Arms wide open; He was bleeding, bleeding </div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
Love's definition, love's definition was looking at me</div><div class="textonly">
Looking at Him hanging on a tree I began to weep and weep and weep and weep</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
This is how I know what love is, this is how I know what love is</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
He said to me: 'You shall love Me, You shall love Me.'</div><br class="smallbreak"> <div class="textonly">
If anybody's looking for love in all the wrong places</div><div class="textonly">
If you've been searching for love come to Me, come to Me</div><div class="textonly">
Take up your cross, deny yourself. Forget your father's house and run, run with Me</div><div class="textonly">
You were made for abandonment, wholeheartedness. </div><div class="textonly">
You were made for someone greater, someone bigger, so: Follow Me. </div><div class="textonly">
And You'll come alive when you learn to die</div><br class="smallbreak"> </br> <div id="ccli">5860285</div>
