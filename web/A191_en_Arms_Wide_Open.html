I once believed that love was romance, just a chance
I even thought that love was for the lucky and the beautiful
I once believed that love was a momentary bliss but love is more than this

All You ever wanted was my attention, all You ever wanted was love from me
All You ever wanted was my affections, to sit here at Your feet

Then I sat down, a little frustrated and confused
If all of life comes down to love then love has to be more than sentiment
More than selfishness and selfish gain

And then I saw Him there hanging on a tree, looking at me
I saw Him there hanging on a tree, looking at me
He was looking at me, looking at Him, staring through me
I could not escape those beautiful eyes and I began to weep and weep

 He had <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>arms wide <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>open, a <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D/F#</span></span>heart ex<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Asus4</span></span>posed 
  <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>Arms wide <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>open; He was <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D/F#</span></span>bleeding, <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Asus4</span></span>bleeding 
 </div></div>


Love's definition, love's definition was looking at me
Looking at Him hanging on a tree I began to weep and weep and weep and weep


<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>This is how I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>know what love is, <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D/F#</span></span>this is how I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Asus4</span></span>know what love is


Tag:
He said to me: <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>'You shall <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>love <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D/F#</span></span>Me, You shall <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Asus4</span></span>love <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>Me.'


Outro:
If anybody's looking for love in all the wrong places
If you've been searching for love come to Me, come to Me
Take up your cross, deny yourself.
Forget your father's house and run, run with Me
You were made for abandonment, wholeheartedness
You were made for someone greater, someone bigger, so: Follow Me
And You'll come alive when you learn to die
