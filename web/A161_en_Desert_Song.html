1. <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>This is my prayer <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>in the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>desert
When <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>all that's within <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>me feels d<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>ry
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>This is my prayer <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>in my <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>hunger and need
My <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>God is the God w<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>ho prov<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>ides


2. This is my prayer in the fire, in weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flame


<div class="chorus"><div class="chorus-text">
 I will bring p<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>raise, I will bring p<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>raise 
 No weapon <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>formed against me shall rem<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>ain 
 I will re<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>joice, I will dec<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>lare 
 God is my <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>victory and <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>He is <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>here 
 </div></div>



3. This is my prayer in the battle, when triumph is still on its way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ, so firm on His promise I'll stand


4. This is my prayer in the harvest, when favour and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again, the seed I've received I will sow

<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>All of my life, in every season
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>You are still God, I have a reason to <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>sing.
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>I have a reason to w<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>orship.
