1. <span class="chord" chord="Bm">This</span> is my prayer <span class="chord" chord="A">in</span> the <span class="chord" chord="G">desert</span>
When <span class="chord-space" chord="Bm">all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> that's within <span class="chord" chord="A">me</span> feels d<span class="chord-space" chord="G">ry&nbsp;</span>
<span class="chord" chord="Bm">This</span> is my prayer <span class="chord" chord="A">in</span> my <span class="chord" chord="G">hunger</span> and need
My <span class="chord" chord="Bm">God</span> is the God w<span class="chord" chord="A">ho</span> prov<span class="chord" chord="G">ides</span>


2. This is my prayer in the fire, in weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flame


<div class="chorus"><div class="chorus-text">
 I will bring p<span class="chord" chord="D">raise,</span> I will bring p<span class="chord" chord="A">raise</span> 
 No weapon <span class="chord" chord="G">formed</span> against me shall rem<span class="chord" chord="D">ain</span> 
 I will re<span class="chord" chord="A">joice,</span> I will dec<span class="chord" chord="Bm">lare</span> 
 God is my <span class="chord" chord="G">victory</span> and <span class="chord" chord="A">He</span> is <span class="chord" chord="Bm">here</span> 
 </div></div>



3. This is my prayer in the battle, when triumph is still on its way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ, so firm on His promise I'll stand


4. This is my prayer in the harvest, when favour and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again, the seed I've received I will sow

<span class="chord" chord="D">All</span> of my life, in every season
<span class="chord" chord="Bm">You</span> are still God, I have a reason to <span class="chord" chord="A">sing.</span>
<span class="chord-space" chord="G">I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> have a reason to w<span class="chord" chord="D">orship.</span>
