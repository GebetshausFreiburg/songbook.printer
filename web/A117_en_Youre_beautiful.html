1. <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>I see Your face in <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>every sunrise
The <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>colors of the morning are in<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>side Your eyes
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>The world awakens in the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>light of the day
I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>look up to the sky and <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>say: You're beautiful
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>Oh.<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>.. <span class="chord"><span class="inner">Bm</span></span>Oh.<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>.. Youre beautiful


2. I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
Its all proclaiming who You are
Youre beautiful, You're beautiful

3. I see you there hanging on a tree
You bled and then you died
and then you rose again for me
Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home
Youre beautiful, you're beautiful

4. When we arrive at eternitys shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
Well enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and well sing
Youre beautiful, You're beautiful, You're beautiful
