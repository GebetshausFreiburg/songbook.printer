1. <span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>I've been tested and tried when You counted on me, but I've <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>failed You, oh I've <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>failed You.
And the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>prayers I prayed, promises I made, I could not keep <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>them though I've <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>tried.
I should <span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>know by know by now that I can run to You and You'll embrace <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>me, not for<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>sake me.
That it's <span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>not my goodness, that caused You to love me, but in my <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>failures You loved me still.


2. <span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>How many ways could I tell You, that I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>love You, oh I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>love You.
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>How many ways can I tell You, that I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>need You, oh I need <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>You.
You <span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>always provide and You care for me. I'm so <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>grateful - so <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>thankful.
Every<span class="chord"><span class="inner">C</span></span>thing is mine because I am Yours. What <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>else do I need, when there is no more.



Pre-Chorus:
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>And the weakness of God<span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m</span></span>is stronger than the strength <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>of man
And the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">E</span></span>shame is leaving me now
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>This is what I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m</span></span>want, to be drawn near<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>to be set <span class="chord"><span class="inner">E</span></span>free.
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>There is now no condemnation for those <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>who are in You, Lord.
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>I still want to walk with You, to ta<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>lk with You, to hear <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>Your voice.

<div class="chorus"><div class="chorus-text">
  <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>I'm holding on to the hem of Your garment, I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>won't let go 'till the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>blessing comes. 
  <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>I'm bowing low at the foot of the cross. For You <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>my Lord, I would <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>give it all. 
  <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>I'm holding on to the hem of Your garment, I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>won't let go 'till the <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>healing comes. 
  <span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>I'm bowing low at the foot of the cross. To <span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>be transformed this is <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>what I want.

Bridge:
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>You could offer me thi<span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m</span></span>ngs, silver lined dreams<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>.
But to be trans<span class="chord"><span class="inner">E</span></span>formed into the image of God<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>This is what I <span class="chord"><span class="inner">F#m</span></span>want, to be drawn near<span class="chord"><span class="inner">D</span></span>, to be set free<span class="chord"><span class="inner">E</span></span>.
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>And in all of my mistakes I know<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>You love me still.
<span class="chord"><span class="inner">F</span></span>I want to know what pleases You, I'm bro<span class="chord"><span class="inner">G</span></span>ken Lord, I'm broken <span class="chord"><span class="inner">A</span></span>Lord.
