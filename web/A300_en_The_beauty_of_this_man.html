2. For the sake of love, He left His Father's throne 
Searching for a bride, bone of His bone 
Such a humble kiss to make my dust His own 
Oh the beauty of this Man 
 
3. See His hands, His head, His feet and His side 
They bear the marks of wrath, a pure sacrifice 
To secure my love by giving up His life 
Oh the beauty of this Man 
 
4. She now faint with love, beckons Him to come 
Establish righteousness as God's risen son 
On that glorious day, she'll marry her fair One 
Oh the beauty of this Man
