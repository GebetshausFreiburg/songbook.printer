My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness. 
I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus name. 
 
When darkness seems to veil his face, I rest on his unchanging grace. 
In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil. 
 
His oath, his covenant and blood support me in the whelming flood. 
When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay. 
 
When the last trumpet sounds, oh may I then in him be found, 
Clothed in his righteousness alone faultless to stand before his throne.
